# Absolute Position Properties

## Overview

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#common-absolute-position-properties -->

The common absolute position properties control the placement of absolutely positioned areas. These properties are used primarily with `fo:block-container` when its `absolute-position` property is set to `absolute` or `fixed`. The offset properties (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`) specify the position of the content-rectangle relative to the nearest ancestor reference area's coordinate system.

## Properties

### absolute-position

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `auto \| absolute \| fixed \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:block-container |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#absolute-position -->

A property derived from a CSS2 property.

Values have the following meanings:

- **auto** -- There is no absolute-positioning constraint. Positioning is in accordance with the `relative-position` property.
- **absolute** -- The area's position (and possibly size) is specified with the `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` properties. These properties specify offsets with respect to the area's nearest ancestor reference area. Absolutely positioned areas are taken out of the normal flow. This means they have no impact on the layout of later siblings. Also, though absolutely positioned areas have margins, they do not collapse with any other margins.
- **fixed** -- The area's position is calculated according to the "absolute" model, but in addition, the area is fixed with respect to some reference. In the case of continuous media, the area is fixed with respect to the viewport (and doesn't move when scrolled). In the case of paged media, the area is fixed with respect to the page, even if that page is seen through a viewport (in the case of a print-preview, for example). Authors may wish to specify "fixed" in a media-dependent way.

The following additional restrictions apply for paged presentations:

- Only objects with `absolute-position="auto"` may have page/column breaks. For other values any keep and break properties are ignored.
- The area generated is a descendant of the page-area where the first area from the object would have been placed had the object had `absolute-position="auto"` specified.

If the value is "absolute" or "fixed", any normal areas generated by the formatting object have their area-class changed to `xsl-absolute` or `xsl-fixed`, respectively.

### top

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<length> \| <percentage> \| auto \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:block-container (when absolutely positioned) |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to height of containing block |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#top -->

CSS2 Definition (as amended by errata).

This property specifies how far a box's top margin edge is offset below the top edge of the box's containing block.

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:** See definition of property `left`.

### right

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<length> \| <percentage> \| auto \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:block-container (when absolutely positioned) |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to width of containing block |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#right -->

CSS2 Definition (as amended by errata).

This property specifies how far a box's right margin edge is offset to the left of the right edge of the box's containing block.

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:** See definition of property `left`.

### bottom

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<length> \| <percentage> \| auto \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:block-container (when absolutely positioned) |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to height of containing block |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#bottom -->

CSS2 Definition (as amended by errata).

This property specifies how far a box's bottom margin edge is offset above the bottom edge of the box's containing block.

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:** See definition of property `left`.

### left

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<length> \| <percentage> \| auto \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:block-container (when absolutely positioned) |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to width of containing block |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#left -->

CSS2 Definition (as amended by errata).

This property specifies how far a box's left margin edge is offset to the right of the left edge of the box's containing block.

The values of the four position offset properties have the following meanings:

- **auto** -- The effect of this value depends on which of the related properties have the value "auto" as well. See the sections on the width and height of absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements for details.
- **\<length\>** -- The offset is a fixed distance from the reference edge.
- **\<percentage\>** -- The offset is a percentage of the containing block's width (for `left` or `right`) or height (for `top` and `bottom`). For `top` and `bottom`, if the height of the containing block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content height), the percentage value is interpreted like "auto".

For absolutely positioned boxes, the offsets are with respect to the box's containing block. For relatively positioned boxes, the offsets are with respect to the outer edges of the box itself (i.e., the box is given a position in the normal flow, then offset from that position according to these properties).

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:**

These properties set the position of the content-rectangle of the associated area.

The `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are interpreted in the prevailing coordinate system (established by the nearest ancestor reference area) and not relative to the "containing block" as in CSS.

If both `left` and `right` have a value other than "auto", then if the `width` is "auto" the width of the content-rectangle is overridden; else the geometry is overconstrained and is resolved in accordance with the overconstrained geometry rules. Similarly, if both `top` and `bottom` have a value other than "auto", then if the `height` is "auto" the height of the content-rectangle is overridden; else the geometry is overconstrained and is resolved in accordance with the overconstrained geometry rules.
