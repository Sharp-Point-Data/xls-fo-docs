# Area Alignment Properties

## Overview

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#area-alignment -->

The area alignment properties control the alignment of inline-areas with respect to each other, particularly in relation to the mixing of different baselines for different scripts. In addition, properties "display-align" and "relative-align" control the placement of block-areas. These properties are critical for correct multi-script typesetting and precise positioning of inline content such as graphics, subscripts, and superscripts.

## Properties

### alignment-adjust

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `auto \| baseline \| before-edge \| text-before-edge \| middle \| central \| after-edge \| text-after-edge \| ideographic \| alphabetic \| hanging \| mathematical \| <percentage> \| <length> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:character, fo:external-graphic, fo:instream-foreign-object, fo:inline, fo:inline-container, fo:leader, fo:page-number, fo:page-number-citation, fo:page-number-citation-last, fo:scaling-value-citation, fo:basic-link |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#alignment-adjust -->

The "alignment-adjust" property allows more precise alignment of areas generated by formatting objects, in particular for formatting objects, such as graphics, that do not have a baseline-table or lack the desired baseline in their baseline-table. With the "alignment-adjust" property, the position of the baseline identified by the "alignment-baseline" can be explicitly determined.

Values have the following meaning:

- **auto** -- For a glyph, the alignment-point is the intersection of the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the glyph-area and the block-progression-direction position of the alignment-point from the font. For other inline-areas, the alignment-point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle and the baseline identified by the "alignment-baseline" property if this baseline exists in the baseline-table for the dominant-baseline for the inline-area. For areas generated by an fo:external-graphic or fo:instream-foreign-object, the alignment point is at the intersection of the start-edge and after-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the area.
- **baseline** -- The alignment-point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle and the dominant-baseline of the area.
- **before-edge** -- The alignment-point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle and the "before-edge" baseline of the area.
- **text-before-edge** -- The alignment-point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle and the "text-before-edge" baseline of the area.
- **central** -- The alignment-point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle and the "central" baseline of the area.
- **middle** -- The alignment-point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle and the "middle" baseline of the area.
- **after-edge** -- The alignment-point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle and the "after-edge" baseline of the area.
- **text-after-edge** -- The alignment-point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle and the "text-after-edge" baseline of the area.
- **ideographic** -- The alignment-point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle and the "ideographic" baseline of the area.
- **alphabetic** -- The alignment-point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle and the "alphabetic" baseline of the area.
- **hanging** -- The alignment-point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle and the "hanging" baseline of the area.
- **mathematical** -- The alignment-point is at the intersection of the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle and the "mathematical" baseline of the area.
- **\<percentage\>** -- The computed value of the property is this percentage multiplied by the area's computed "height" if the area is generated by an fo:external-graphic or fo:instream-foreign-object, the "font-size" if the area was generated by an fo:character, and the "line-height" otherwise. The alignment-point is on the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the area being aligned. Its position along the start-edge relative to the intersection of the dominant-baseline and the start-edge is offset by the computed value. A value of "0%" makes the dominant-baseline the alignment point.
- **\<length\>** -- The alignment-point is on the start-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the area being aligned. Its position along the start-edge relative to the intersection of the dominant-baseline and the start-edge is offset by the length value. A value of "0cm" makes the dominant-baseline the alignment point.

Implementations must support at least one of the "alignment-adjust" values defined in this Recommendation.

### alignment-baseline

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `auto \| baseline \| before-edge \| text-before-edge \| middle \| central \| after-edge \| text-after-edge \| ideographic \| alphabetic \| hanging \| mathematical \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:character, fo:external-graphic, fo:instream-foreign-object, fo:inline, fo:inline-container, fo:leader, fo:page-number, fo:page-number-citation, fo:page-number-citation-last, fo:scaling-value-citation, fo:basic-link |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#alignment-baseline -->

This property specifies how an object is aligned with respect to its parent. That is, to which of the parent's baselines the alignment-point of this object is aligned. The alignment-adjust property specifies how the alignment point is determined. It defaults to the baseline with the same name as the computed value of the alignment-baseline property.

Values have the following meanings:

- **auto** -- The computed value depends on the kind of object on which it is being used. For fo:character, the value is the dominant-baseline of the script to which the character belongs. If the value of the "script" property on the parent formatting object is other than "auto" then use the baseline for that script; otherwise, use the dominant-baseline of the parent. For all other objects, the value is computed as for the "baseline" value.
- **baseline** -- The alignment-point of the object being aligned is aligned with the dominant-baseline of the parent area.
- **before-edge** -- The alignment-point of the object being aligned is aligned with the "before-edge" baseline of the parent area.
- **text-before-edge** -- The alignment-point of the object being aligned is aligned with the "text-before-edge" baseline of the parent area.
- **central** -- The alignment-point of the object being aligned is aligned with the "central" baseline of the parent area.
- **middle** -- The alignment-point of the object being aligned is aligned with the "middle" baseline of the parent area.
- **after-edge** -- The alignment-point of the object being aligned is aligned with the "after-edge" baseline of the parent area.
- **text-after-edge** -- The alignment-point of the object being aligned is aligned with the "text-after-edge" baseline of the parent area.
- **ideographic** -- The alignment-point of the object being aligned is aligned with the "ideographic" baseline of the parent area.
- **alphabetic** -- The alignment-point of the object being aligned is aligned with the "alphabetic" baseline of the parent area.
- **hanging** -- The alignment-point of the object being aligned is aligned with the "hanging" baseline of the parent area.
- **mathematical** -- The alignment-point of the object being aligned is aligned with the "mathematical" baseline of the parent area.

Implementations must support at least one of the "alignment-baseline" values defined in this Recommendation.

### baseline-shift

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `baseline \| sub \| super \| <percentage> \| <length> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `baseline` |
| **Applies to** | fo:character, fo:external-graphic, fo:instream-foreign-object, fo:inline, fo:inline-container, fo:leader, fo:page-number, fo:page-number-citation, fo:page-number-citation-last, fo:scaling-value-citation, fo:basic-link |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refers to the "line-height" of the parent area |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#baseline-shift -->

The "baseline-shift" property allows repositioning of the dominant-baseline relative to the dominant-baseline of the parent area. The shifted object might be a subscript or superscript. Within the shifted object, the whole baseline-table is offset; not just a single baseline. The amount of the shift is determined from information from the parent area, the subscript or superscript offset from the nominal-font of the parent area, percent of the "line-height" of the parent area or an absolute value.

When the value of "baseline-shift" is other than "0", then the baseline-table font-size component of the "dominant-baseline" property is re-computed to use the "font-size" applicable to the formatting object on which the non-zero "baseline-shift" property is specified.

Values have the following meaning:

- **baseline** -- There is no baseline shift; the dominant-baseline remains in its original position.
- **sub** -- The dominant-baseline is shifted to the default position for subscripts. The offset to this position is determined using the font data for the nominal font. Because in most fonts the subscript position is normally given relative to the "alphabetic" baseline, the User Agent may compute the effective position for subscripts when some other baseline is dominant. The resulting offset is determined by multiplying the effective subscript position by the dominant baseline-table font-size. If there is no applicable font data the User Agent may use heuristics to determine the offset.
- **super** -- The dominant-baseline is shifted to the default position for superscripts. The offset to this position is determined using the font data for the nominal font. The resulting offset is determined by multiplying the effective superscript position by the dominant baseline-table font-size. If there is no applicable font data the User Agent may use heuristics to determine the offset.
- **\<percentage\>** -- The computed value of the property is this percentage multiplied by the computed "line-height" of the parent area. The dominant-baseline is shifted in the shift-direction (positive value) or opposite to the shift-direction (negative value) of the parent area by the computed value. A value of "0%" is equivalent to "baseline".
- **\<length\>** -- The dominant-baseline is shifted in the shift-direction (positive value) or opposite to the shift-direction (negative value) of the parent area by the length value. A value of "0cm" is equivalent to "baseline".

Note: Although "baseline-shift" and "alignment-adjust" properties may seem to do the same thing, there is an important difference. For "alignment-adjust" the percentage values refer to the "line-height" of the area being aligned. For "baseline-shift" the percentage values refer to the "line-height" of the parent. Using the "alignment-adjust" property is more suitable for positioning objects such as graphics that have no internal textual structure. Using the "baseline-shift" property is intended for subscripts and superscripts where the positioned object may itself be a textual object.

### block-unit

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<length>` |
| **Initial** | `0pt` |
| **Applies to** | fo:region-body, fo:region-before, fo:region-after, fo:region-start, fo:region-end, fo:block-container |
| **Inherited** | Yes |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#block-unit -->

When this property is set and non-zero, the block dimension of each generated area must be rounded up to the nearest multiple of the property value.

A value of zero means that there is no such constraint on the area block dimension.

The block dimension of each generated area should be rounded up to the nearest greater value that is an integer multiple of the specified length. The difference between the original block dimension and the rounded one must be transformed into a space-before and/or a space-after (according to the area position and the space conditionality).

The property applies to fo:region-* and fo:block-container, and defines how to adjust the block dimension of the first-level block formatting objects (the direct children of either fo:flow or fo:static-content).

The intended consequence is that lines of text on facing pages will line up, and also that show-through of lines printed on the other side of a page will be reduced, because the lines of text are printed in corresponding places on each side of the paper.

### display-align

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `auto \| before \| center \| after \| inherit \| justify` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:region-body, fo:region-before, fo:region-after, fo:region-start, fo:region-end, fo:block-container, fo:inline-container, fo:table-cell |
| **Inherited** | Yes |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#display-align -->

This property specifies the alignment, in the block-progression-direction, of the areas that are the children of a reference-area.

Values have the following meaning:

- **auto** -- If the relative-align property applies to this formatting object the "relative-align" property is used. If not, this value is treated as if "before" had been specified.
- **before** -- The before-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the first child area is placed coincident with the before-edge of the content-rectangle of the reference-area.
- **center** -- The child areas are placed such that the distance between the before-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the first child area and the before-edge of the content-rectangle of the reference-area is the same as the distance between the after-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the last child area and the after-edge of the content-rectangle of the reference-area.
- **after** -- The after-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the last child area is placed coincident with the after-edge of the content-rectangle of the reference-area.
- **justify** -- For each reference area generated by a region, the before-edge of its content-rectangle is placed coincident with the before-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the first child area, and the after-edge of its content-rectangle should be placed coincident with the after-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the last child area. If the application is not able to achieve copyfitting and the accumulated block-dimension of areas is less than the block-dimension of the reference area, the areas are placed as if "auto" had been specified. Note that for block-containers and table cells, the available space (height and width) must be known in advance in order for the implementation to be able to fit the text into that space.

### display-align-last

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `auto \| before \| center \| after \| inherit \| justify` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:region-body, fo:region-before, fo:region-after, fo:region-start, fo:region-end, fo:block-container, fo:inline-container, fo:table-cell |
| **Inherited** | Yes |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#display-align-last -->

This property specifies in the block-direction, of the areas that are the children of a reference-area. It is used to express the alignment of a region in the last page or in any page ending with a forced break.

Values have the following meanings:

- **auto** -- If the relative-align property applies to this formatting object the relative-align property is used. If not, this value is treated as if "before" had been specified.
- **before** -- The before-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the first child area is placed coincident with the before-edge of the content-rectangle of the reference-area.
- **center** -- The child areas are placed such that the distance between the before-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the first child area and the before-edge of the content-rectangle of the reference-area is the same as the distance between the after-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the last child area and the after-edge of the content-rectangle of the reference-area.
- **after** -- The after-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the last child area is placed coincident with the after-edge of the content-rectangle of the reference-area.
- **justify** -- For each reference area generated by a region, the before-edge of its content-rectangle is placed coincident with the before-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the first child area, and the after-edge of its content-rectangle should be placed coincident with the after-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the last child area. If the application is not able to achieve copyfitting and the accumulated block-dimension of areas is less than the block-dimension of the reference area, the areas are placed as if "auto" had been specified.

### display-align-last-column

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `auto \| before \| center \| after \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:region-body |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#display-align-last-column -->

Specifies how to align the last column of a multi-column region. This property specifies the alignment, in the block-direction, of the areas that are the children of a reference-area.

Values have the following meaning:

- **auto** -- If the relative-align property applies to this formatting object the relative-align property is used. If not, this value is treated as if "before" had been specified.
- **before** -- The before-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the first child area is placed coincident with the before-edge of the content-rectangle of the reference-area.
- **center** -- The child areas are placed such that the distance between the before-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the first child area and the before-edge of the content-rectangle of the reference-area is the same as the distance between the after-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the last child area and the after-edge of the content-rectangle of the reference-area.
- **after** -- The after-edge of the allocation-rectangle of the last child area is placed coincident with the after-edge of the content-rectangle of the reference-area.

### dominant-baseline

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `auto \| use-script \| no-change \| reset-size \| ideographic \| alphabetic \| hanging \| mathematical \| central \| middle \| text-after-edge \| text-before-edge \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:character, fo:external-graphic, fo:instream-foreign-object, fo:inline, fo:inline-container, fo:leader, fo:page-number, fo:page-number-citation, fo:page-number-citation-last, fo:scaling-value-citation, fo:basic-link, fo:block |
| **Inherited** | No (see prose) |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#dominant-baseline -->

The "dominant-baseline" property is used to determine or re-determine a scaled-baseline-table. A scaled-baseline-table is a compound value with three components: a baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline, a derived baseline-table and a baseline-table font-size. Some values of the property re-determine all three values; other only re-establish the baseline-table font-size. Although this property is not inherited, components of the scaled-baseline-table propagate to child formatting objects if the "auto" value is used on these.

Note: The derived baseline-table is constructed using a baseline-table in the font that corresponds to the computed value of the "writing-mode".

Values have the following meaning:

- **auto** -- If this property occurs on a block-level formatting object, then the computed value depends on the value of the "script" property. If the value of the "script" property is "auto", then if the "writing-mode" is horizontal, the baseline-identifier for the dominant baseline is set to be "alphabetic", else if the "writing-mode" is vertical, then the baseline-identifier is set to be "central". If the value of the "script" property is anything other than "auto", then the value of the "script" property is used to select the baseline-identifier. Otherwise, if this property is not on a block-level formatting object, then the baseline-identifier, derived baseline-table, and baseline-table font-size remain the same as those of the parent formatting object.
- **use-script** -- The "script" property is used to select the baseline-identifier for the dominant baseline. The derived baseline-table is constructed using the baseline-table in the nominal font that corresponds to the baseline-identifier. The baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the "font-size" property on this formatting object.
- **no-change** -- The dominant-baseline, the baseline-table, and the baseline-table font-size remain the same as that of the parent formatting object.
- **reset-size** -- The dominant-baseline and the baseline-table remain the same, but the baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the "font-size" property on this formatting object. This re-scales the baseline-table for the current "font-size".
- **ideographic** -- The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be "ideographic". The derived baseline-table is constructed using the "ideographic" baseline-table in the nominal font. The baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the "font-size" property on this formatting object.
- **alphabetic** -- The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be "alphabetic". The derived baseline-table is constructed using the "alphabetic" baseline-table in the nominal font. The baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the "font-size" property on this formatting object.
- **hanging** -- The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be "hanging". The derived baseline-table is constructed using the "hanging" baseline-table in the nominal font. The baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the "font-size" property on this formatting object.
- **mathematical** -- The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be "mathematical". The derived baseline-table is constructed using the "mathematical" baseline-table in the nominal font. The baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the "font-size" property on this formatting object.
- **central** -- The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be "central". The derived baseline-table is constructed from the defined baselines in a baseline-table in the nominal font, chosen using the following priority order of baseline-table names: "ideographic", "alphabetic", "hanging", "mathematical". The baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the "font-size" property on this formatting object.
- **middle** -- The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be "middle". The derived baseline-table is constructed from the defined baselines in a baseline-table in the nominal font, chosen using the following priority order of baseline-table names: "alphabetic", "ideographic", "hanging", "mathematical". The baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the "font-size" property on this formatting object.
- **text-after-edge** -- The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be "text-after-edge". The derived baseline-table is constructed from the defined baselines in a baseline-table in the nominal font. The choice of which font baseline-table to use is implementation defined. The baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the "font-size" property on this formatting object.
- **text-before-edge** -- The baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline is set to be "text-before-edge". The derived baseline-table is constructed from the defined baselines in a baseline-table in the nominal font. The choice of which baseline-table to use is implementation defined. The baseline-table font-size is changed to the value of the "font-size" property on this formatting object.

If there is no baseline-table in the nominal font or if the baseline-table lacks an entry for the desired baseline, then the User Agent may use heuristics to determine the position of the desired baseline.

Implementations must support at least one of the "dominant-baseline" values defined in this Recommendation.

### relative-align

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `before \| baseline \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `before` |
| **Applies to** | fo:list-item, fo:table-cell |
| **Inherited** | Yes |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#relative-align -->

This property specifies the alignment, in the block-progression-direction, between two or more areas. If the "display-align" property applies to this formatting object and has a value other than "auto" this property is ignored.

Values have the following meaning:

- **before** -- For an fo:table-cell: for each row, the first child area of all the cells that start in the row and that have this value is placed such that the before-edge of the content-rectangle is placed at the same distance from the row grid. In addition, at least one of these first child areas of the cells has to be placed with the before-edge of its allocation-rectangle coincident with the before-edge of the content-rectangle of the table-cell. For an fo:list-item the before-edge of the first area descendant generated by the fo:list-item-label is placed coincident with the before-edge of the area generated by the fo:list-item. Similarly the before-edge of the first area descendant generated by the fo:list-item-body is placed coincident with the before-edge of the area generated by the fo:list-item.
- **baseline** -- For an fo:table-cell: for each row, the first child area of all the cells that start in the row and that have this value is placed such that the dominant-baseline, as specified on the fo:table-row, of the first line is placed at the same distance from the row grid. For an fo:list-item the distance between the baseline of the first line-area of the first area descendant generated by the fo:list-item-label is the same as the distance between the baseline of the first line-area of the first area descendant generated by the fo:list-item-body.

### marginalia-relative-align

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `before \| baseline \| end \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `before` |
| **Applies to** | fo:marginalia |
| **Inherited** | Yes |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#marginalia-relative-align -->

Specifies the alignment of the marginalia with respect to the text to which it refers. This property specifies the alignment, in the block-direction, between two areas.

Values have the following meanings:

- **before** -- The before-edge of the marginalia-body-area is aligned with the before-edge of the anchor-area.
- **baseline** -- The distance between the baseline of the marginalia-body-area is the same as the distance between the baseline of the anchor-area extension-region-start region.
- **end** -- The after-edge of the marginalia-body-area is aligned with the after-edge of the anchor-area.

### flow-map-dependency-reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<number> \| <distance>` |
| **Initial** | `none` |
| **Applies to** | fo:flow-assignment |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | all |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#flow-map-dependency-reference -->

The given name must exist as the flow-name attribute of a flow in the same flow-map; the property indicates that content in the named flow will be extracted and positioned alongside content in the flow being defined.

The name specified in the flow-map-dependency-reference attribute will normally not be referenced in a flow-source-list in the same flow-assignment, but this is not forbidden, and in that case some or all of the flow content will be duplicated.

### dependency-content-begin

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<name>` |
| **Initial** | `none` |
| **Applies to** | All fo flow elements |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | all |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#dependency-content-begin -->

The dependency-content-begin is set on an element to mark the start of a region in one flow to be synchronized with a similarly-named region in another flow.

An arbitrary identifier used to correlate content placed in separate flows. For the purpose of parallel formatting in the block direction, the start of the generated area is used as the alignment point. If there is no generated area, the point at which the element with this property occurred within its container is used. There must be a corresponding dependency-content-end later in the same flow (that is, later in XML document order).

### dependency-content-end

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<name>` |
| **Initial** | `none` |
| **Applies to** | All fo flow elements |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | all |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#dependency-content-end -->

The dependency-content-end is set on an element to mark the end of a region in one flow that is to be synchronized with a similarly-named region in another flow.

An arbitrary identifier used to correlate content placed in separate flows. For the purpose of parallel formatting in the block direction, the end of the generated area is used as the alignment point. If there is no generated area, the point at which the element with this property occurred within its container is used. The given name must match value of a dependency-content-begin earlier in the same flow (that is, earlier in XML document order).

### keep-with-dependent-content

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `none \| all \| widows \| orphans` |
| **Initial** | `none` |
| **Applies to** | All fo flow elements |
| **Inherited** | Yes |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | all |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#keep-with-dependent-content -->

The keep-with-dependent-content determines how inline content is treated at the boundaries of synchronized spans of flow.

Values have the following meanings:

- **none** -- No keep is applied, and the non dependent content is forced to be moved outside the dependency boundaries.
- **all** -- Forces all the non dependent content to be included in the dependency boundaries.
- **widows** -- Forces all the generated widows to be included in the dependency boundaries.
- **orphans** -- Forces all the generated orphans to be included in the dependency boundaries.
