# Common Relative Position Properties

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#common-relative-position-properties -->

## Overview

The common relative position properties control whether an area is rendered at its normal stacked position or offset from that position. This group includes the `relative-position` property itself and references to the CSS offset properties (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) that specify the magnitude of the offset.

When `relative-position` is set to `relative`, the area is laid out as if it were `static` (normal stacking), but during rendering it is visually displaced by the amounts specified in the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties. The displaced area does not affect the position of any other area -- other areas remain positioned as if the relatively-positioned area were at its original location.

The offset properties `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are defined elsewhere in the spec and are referenced by this property group. See their individual definitions for value syntax and behavior.

## Properties

### relative-position

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `static \| relative \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `static` |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects that generate areas |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |

A property derived from a CSS2 property. Controls whether areas generated by a formatting object are positioned normally or offset relative to their normal position.

Values have the following meanings:

- **static** -- The area is normally stacked.
- **relative** -- The area's position is determined as if it was normally stacked. Only during rendering is the area rendered offset relative to this position. The fact that one area is relatively positioned does not influence the position of any other area. For areas that break over a page boundary, only the portion that would have been on a given page originally is included in the repositioned area on that page. Any portion of the repositioned area that was originally on the current page, but falls off the current page due to repositioning is "off" (typically clipped), thus does not fall onto any other page.

### Referenced Offset Properties

This property group also includes references to the following CSS offset properties, which specify the displacement amounts when `relative-position="relative"`:

- **top** -- See the spec definition at `https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#top`.
- **bottom** -- See the spec definition at `https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#bottom`.
- **left** -- See the spec definition at `https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#left`.
- **right** -- See the spec definition at `https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#right`.
