# fo:list-item

## Summary

The `fo:list-item` formatting object contains the label and the body of an item in a list. It generates one or more normal block-areas that hold the areas returned by its `fo:list-item-label` and `fo:list-item-body` children.

## Areas

The `fo:list-item` formatting object generates one or more normal block-areas. The `fo:list-item` returns these areas, any page-level-out-of-line areas, and any reference-level-out-of-line areas returned by the children of the `fo:list-item`.

## Constraints

- No area may have more than one normal child area returned by the same `fo:list-item` formatting object.
- The children of each normal area returned by an `fo:list-item` formatting object must be normal block-areas returned by the `fo:list-item-label` and the `fo:list-item-body` flow objects and must be properly ordered. Those returned by the `fo:list-item-label` must be properly stacked and those returned by the `fo:list-item-body` must be properly stacked.
- The children of each normal area returned by an `fo:list-item` formatting object returned by the `fo:list-item-label` and `fo:list-item-body` objects are positioned in the block-progression-direction with respect to each other according to the `relative-align` trait.
- In the inline-progression-direction these areas are positioned in the usual manner for properly stacked areas. It is an error if the content-rectangles of the areas overlap.
- The `block-progression-dimension` of the content-rectangle of an area generated by the `fo:list-item` is just large enough so that the allocation-rectangles of all its child areas are contained in it. In particular, the `space-before` and `space-after` of the child areas have no effect on the spacing of the list item. For purposes of the block-stacking constraints the areas generated by `fo:list-item` are treated as if they have a fence preceding and a fence following them.
- These areas are not reference-areas, hence the indents on all objects within them are measured relative to the reference-area that holds the content of the `fo:list-block`.

## Content Model

```xml

In addition this formatting object may have a sequence of zero or more `fo:marker`s as its initial children.

## Usage Notes

- Each `fo:list-item` must contain exactly one `fo:list-item-label` followed by exactly one `fo:list-item-body`.
- The label and body areas are positioned side by side. The indentation of the body is controlled by the `provisional-distance-between-starts` property on the ancestor `fo:list-block`.
- Use `relative-align` to control the vertical alignment between label and body areas (e.g., "before" or "baseline").
- The areas generated by `fo:list-item` are not reference-areas, so `start-indent` and `end-indent` on descendants are measured from the enclosing reference-area (the `fo:list-block` containing reference-area), not from the list-item itself.
