# fo:region-after

## Summary

The `fo:region-after` formatting object is used in constructing an `fo:simple-page-master`. It specifies a viewport/reference pair that is located on the "after" side of the page-reference-area. In lr-tb `writing-mode`, this region corresponds to the footer region. The `overflow` trait controls how much of the underlying region-reference-area is visible; that is, whether the region-reference-area is clipped by its parent region-viewport-area.

## Areas

The `fo:region-after` formatting object is used to generate one region-viewport-area and one region-reference-area.

The values of the `padding` and `border-width` traits must be "0".

The after-edge of the content-rectangle of this region-viewport-area is positioned coincident with the after-edge of the content-rectangle of the page-reference-area generated using the parent `fo:simple-page-master`. The `block-progression-dimension` of the region-viewport-area is determined by the `extent` trait on the `fo:region-after` formatting object.

The `inline-progression-dimension` of the region-viewport-area is determined by the `precedence` trait on the `fo:region-after`:
- If the value of the `precedence` trait is `true`, the `inline-progression-dimension` extends up to the start-edge and end-edge of the content-rectangle of the page-reference-area. In this case, the region-after region-viewport-area acts like a float into areas generated by the region-start and region-end.
- If the value of the `precedence` trait is `false`, the adjacent regions float into the area generated by the `fo:region-after` and the extent of the `fo:region-after` is effectively reduced by the incursions of the adjacent regions.

The region-reference-area lies on a canvas underneath the region-viewport-area.

The size of the region-reference-area depends on the setting of the `overflow` trait:
- If the value is "auto", "hidden", "error-if-overflow", "paginate", or "visible", the size of the reference-area is the same as the size of the viewport.
- If the value is "scroll", the size of the reference-area is equal to the size of the viewport in the inline-progression-direction in the `writing-mode` for the region and has no constraint in the block-progression-direction (which implies that it grows to hold the distribution of all the content bound to the region).

## Content Model

```
EMPTY
```

The `fo:region-after` has no children. It is an empty element whose properties configure the region.

## Trait Derivation

The `reference-orientation` and `writing-mode` of the region-viewport-area are determined by the formatting object that generates the area (see `fo:page-sequence`). The `reference-orientation` of the region-reference-area is set to "0" and is therefore the same as the orientation established by the region-viewport-area. The `writing-mode` of the region-reference-area is set to the same value as that of the region-viewport-area.

## Constraints

The constraints on the size and position of the region-reference-area generated using the `fo:region-after` are covered in the "Constraints applicable to regions" section of `fo:simple-page-master`.

## Usage Notes

- The `fo:region-after` is typically used for page footers. In lr-tb writing-mode, this is the region at the bottom of the page.
- The `extent` property determines the block-progression-dimension (height in lr-tb) of this region.
- The `precedence` property controls whether the region-after extends the full width of the page or gives way to `fo:region-start` and `fo:region-end`:
  - `precedence="true"` means the region-after spans the full page width; region-start and region-end are shortened to accommodate it.
  - `precedence="false"` (the default) means region-start and region-end extend to the page edges, and region-after is narrowed.
- The default `region-name` is "xsl-region-after". A custom `region-name` may be specified for use with `fo:static-content` via the `flow-name` property.
- Content is assigned to this region by an `fo:static-content` whose `flow-name` matches the `region-name` of this region.

## Code Samples

No code samples in spec for this formatting object's own section. However, `fo:region-after` appears in code samples in other spec sections:

### Region-after with extent for a page footer

<!-- Source: xslspec.xml line 10510 -->
```xml
<fo:region-after extent="10mm"/>
```

This is used with a matching `fo:static-content`:

<!-- Source: xslspec.xml line 10510 -->
```xml
<fo:static-content flow-name="xsl-region-after">
  <fo:block>Page <fo:page-number/>
  </fo:block>
</fo:static-content>
```

### Region-after with precedence in a full page-master

<!-- Source: xslspec.xml line 9395 -->
```xml
<fo:region-after precedence="true" extent="1.5cm"/>
```

When `precedence="true"`, the region-after spans the full page width. The `extent` property sets the height of the footer region.

For comprehensive examples of managing region-after heights across different page-masters, see **guide-conditional-page-layouts**.
