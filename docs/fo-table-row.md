# fo:table-row

## Summary

The `fo:table-row` formatting object is used to group table-cells into rows. All table-cells in a table-row start in the same geometric row on the table grid.

## Areas

The `fo:table-row` formatting object does not generate any areas. It returns the sequence of areas created by concatenating the sequences of areas returned by each of the children of the `fo:table-row`. The `fo:table-row` holds a specification of some presentation characteristics, such as `background`, which affects the areas generated by the `fo:table` (see `fo:table`).

## Constraints

- The order of concatenation of the sequences of areas returned by the children of the `fo:table-row` is the same order as the children are ordered under the `fo:table-row`.
- The method for determining the height of the row in the grid is governed by the `row-height` trait.

## Content Model

```
(fo:table-cell+)
```

In addition this formatting object may have a sequence of zero or more `fo:marker`s as its initial children.

| Common Aural Properties | N/A | Extended |
| Common Border, Padding, and Background Properties | N/A | Basic (see note) |
| Common Relative Position Properties | N/A | Extended |
| `border-after-precedence` | no | Basic (collapsing) |
| `border-before-precedence` | no | Basic (collapsing) |
| `border-end-precedence` | no | Basic (collapsing) |
| `border-start-precedence` | no | Basic (collapsing) |
| `break-after` | no | Basic |
| `break-before` | no | Basic |
| `id` | N/A | Basic |
| `index-class` | N/A | Extended |
| `index-key` | N/A | Extended |
| `height` | no | Basic |
| `keep-together` | no | Extended |
| `keep-with-next` | no | Extended |
| `keep-with-previous` | no | Extended |
| `visibility` | no | Extended |

**Note on Border, Padding, and Background Properties:** Only the background properties (`background-attachment`, `background-color`, `background-image`, `background-repeat`, `background-position-horizontal`, `background-position-vertical`) from this set apply. If the value of `border-collapse` is "collapse" or "collapse-with-precedence" for the table, the border properties (`border-before-color`, `border-before-style`, `border-before-width`, `border-after-color`, `border-after-style`, `border-after-width`, `border-start-color`, `border-start-style`, `border-start-width`, `border-end-color`, `border-end-style`, `border-end-width`, `border-top-color`, `border-top-style`, `border-top-width`, `border-bottom-color`, `border-bottom-style`, `border-bottom-width`, `border-left-color`, `border-left-style`, `border-left-width`, `border-right-color`, `border-right-style`, `border-right-width`) also apply.

## Usage Notes

- Using `fo:table-row` is optional. As an alternative, `fo:table-cell` children can be placed directly under `fo:table-header`, `fo:table-footer`, or `fo:table-body`, using the `starts-row` and `ends-row` properties to indicate row boundaries.
- The `height` (or `block-progression-dimension`) property on a row sets the minimum row height. If the content of any cell in the row is taller, the row expands.
- Use `break-before` and `break-after` to force page or column breaks at specific row boundaries.
- Use `keep-together`, `keep-with-next`, and `keep-with-previous` to control how rows break across pages.
- The `fo:table-row` does not generate areas itself but passes through areas from its child cells. Its background affects the rendering layer behind the cells (per CSS2 table rendering model).

## Code Samples

No code samples in spec for this formatting object's own section. The content model is `(table-cell+)`.
