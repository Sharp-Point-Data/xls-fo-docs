# fo:block-container

## Summary

The fo:block-container flow object is used to generate a block-level reference-area, typically containing text blocks with a different writing-mode. In addition, it can also be used with a different reference-orientation to rotate its content.

The use of this flow object is not required for changing the inline-progression-direction only; in that case the Unicode BIDI algorithm and the fo:bidi-override are sufficient.

## Content Model

```
(%block;)+
```

The fo:block-container must contain one or more block-level formatting objects.

In addition, an fo:block-container that does not generate an absolutely positioned area may have a sequence of zero or more fo:markers as its initial children.

## Areas

The fo:block-container formatting object generates one or more viewport/reference pairs. All generated viewport-areas are subject to the constraints given by the block-progression-dimension and inline-progression-dimension traits of the fo:block-container. The fo:block-container returns these areas and any page-level-out-of-line areas returned by the children of the fo:block-container.

In the case that the block-progression-dimension.maximum is other than "auto", then overflow processing may apply. The "repeat" value of overflow can be used to generate multiple viewport/reference pairs if this is desired rather than clipping or scrolling.

If the absolute-position trait is "auto", these areas all have an area-class of "xsl-normal". If the absolute-position trait is "absolute" or "fixed" then there is one viewport/reference pair, and its area-class is "xsl-absolute" or "xsl-fixed", respectively.

## Trait Derivation

The reference-orientation and writing-mode traits of the viewport-area and reference-area come from the fo:block-container. These determine the orientation of the start-edge, end-edge, before-edge, and after-edge of the content-rectangle of the viewport-area, and of the padding-, border-, and content-rectangles of the reference-area.

The reference-orientation of the reference-area is set to "0" and is, therefore, the same as the orientation established by the viewport-area. The inline-progression-dimension of the reference-area is the same as that of the viewport-area, and may not be "auto" if the inline-progression-direction is different from that of the parent of the fo:block-container. The block-progression-dimension of the reference-area is not constrained; thus the reference-area may be larger than the viewport-area and this may cause the overflow property to operate.

As a property value applies to each of the areas generated by this flow object, the size can vary from instance to instance if the value is "auto" or a length-range.

## Constraints

The children of each reference-area generated by an fo:block-container formatting object must be normal block-areas returned by the children of the fo:block-container, must be properly stacked, and must be properly ordered.

Any reference-level-out-of-line areas returned by the children of the fo:block-container are handled as described in the fo:float specification.

## Usage Notes

- Use fo:block-container to establish a new reference area with a different writing-mode (e.g., vertical text within a horizontal layout).
- Use reference-orientation to rotate content by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
- Use absolute-position="absolute" or "fixed" to create absolutely or fixed positioned areas.
- The overflow property controls behavior when content exceeds the specified dimensions.
- Use block-progression-dimension and inline-progression-dimension (or height and width) to set explicit dimensions.
- display-align controls vertical alignment of content within the container.
