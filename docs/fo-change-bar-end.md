# fo:change-bar-end

## Summary

The `fo:change-bar-end` is used to indicate the end of a "change region" that is started by its matching `fo:change-bar-begin`. See `fo:change-bar-begin` for details on change bar behavior.

## Areas

The `fo:change-bar-end` formatting object does not in itself generate any areas, but it causes areas to be generated by the ancestor `fo:page-sequence` object, near the start or end edge of a normal-flow-reference-area or region-reference-area.

## Constraints

- Preceding this `fo:change-bar-end` in document order, there must be an `fo:change-bar-begin` with which it forms a matching pair. If there is no such `fo:change-bar-begin`, it is an error, and the implementation should recover by ignoring this `fo:change-bar-end`.

## Usage Notes

- The `change-bar-class` property must match the `change-bar-class` value of the corresponding `fo:change-bar-begin` to form a matching pair.
- The `fo:change-bar-end` does not carry the visual styling properties (color, width, style, etc.); those are specified on the matching `fo:change-bar-begin`.
