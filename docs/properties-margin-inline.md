# Common Margin Properties - Inline

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#common-margin-properties-inline -->

## Overview

The common margin properties for inline-level formatting objects control the spacing around inline areas in the inline-progression-direction. This group includes references to the CSS-compatible absolute margin properties (`margin-top`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`, `margin-right`) defined in the block margin properties group, plus two XSL-FO native properties specific to inline-level spacing: `space-start` and `space-end`.

The `space-start` and `space-end` properties use writing-mode-relative directions and operate in the inline-progression-direction (the direction in which inline content flows). Like `space-before` and `space-after` for block areas, these use the `<space>` compound datatype with minimum/optimum/maximum components plus conditionality and precedence.

The CSS-compatible margin properties (`margin-top`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`, `margin-right`) are also part of this group. Their definitions are shared with the block margin properties; see [Common Margin Properties - Block](properties-margin-block.md) for full details on those properties.

## Properties

### space-end

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<space> \| <percentage> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `space.minimum=0pt, .optimum=0pt, .maximum=0pt, .conditionality=discard, .precedence=0` |
| **Applies to** | inline-level formatting objects |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to inline-progression-dimension of closest ancestor block-area that is not a line-area |

Specifies the minimum, optimum, and maximum values for the space after any areas generated by this formatting object and the conditionality and precedence of this space.

Specifies the value of the space-specifier for the space after the areas generated by this formatting object. A definition of space-specifiers, and the interaction between space-specifiers occurring in sequence are given in the spec section on space resolution.

Values have the following meanings:

- **\<space\>** -- The "space-end" is specified as a space.
- **\<percentage\>** -- The "space-end" is specified as a percentage of the inline-progression-dimension of the closest ancestor block-area.

Note: A common example of such a sequence is the "space-end" on one area and the "space-start" of its next sibling.

### space-start

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<space> \| <percentage> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `space.minimum=0pt, .optimum=0pt, .maximum=0pt, .conditionality=discard, .precedence=0` |
| **Applies to** | inline-level formatting objects |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to inline-progression-dimension of closest ancestor block-area that is not a line-area |

Specifies the minimum, optimum, and maximum values for the space before any areas generated by this formatting object and the conditionality and precedence of this space.

Specifies the value of the space-specifier for the space before the areas generated by this formatting object. A definition of space-specifiers, and the interaction between space-specifiers occurring in sequence are given in the spec section on space resolution.

Values have the following meanings:

- **\<space\>** -- The "space-start" is specified as a space.
- **\<percentage\>** -- The "space-start" is specified as a percentage of the inline-progression-dimension of the closest ancestor block-area.

Note: A common example of such a sequence is the "space-end" on one area and the "space-start" of its next sibling.
