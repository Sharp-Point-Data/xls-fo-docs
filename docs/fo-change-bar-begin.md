# fo:change-bar-begin

## Summary

The `fo:change-bar-begin` is used to indicate the beginning of a "change region" that is ended by the subsequent `fo:change-bar-end` whose `change-bar-class` property value matches that of the `change-bar-class` property on this `fo:change-bar-begin` and is at the same nesting level (relative to other `fo:change-bar-begin`/`fo:change-bar-end` pairs with the same `change-bar-class` property value).

The change region is decorated with a change bar down either the start or end edge of the column. A change bar is generated alongside the areas generated within the region-body's non-conditional reference area by the formatting objects "under the change bar influence". All formatting objects after (in document order) this `fo:change-bar-begin` and up to the matching `fo:change-bar-end` (or end of document) are considered under the change bar influence of this `fo:change-bar-begin`.

## Areas

The `fo:change-bar-begin` formatting object does not in itself generate any areas, but it causes areas to be generated by the ancestor `fo:page-sequence` object, near the start or end edge of a normal-flow-reference-area or region-reference-area.

## Constraints

- An `fo:change-bar-begin`/`fo:change-bar-end` pair is considered a matching pair if (1) the value of their `change-bar-class` properties are identical and (2) between (in document order) the `fo:change-bar-begin` and `fo:change-bar-end` formatting objects, the only occurrences of `fo:change-bar-begin` and `fo:change-bar-end` formatting objects of that class (if any) are matching pairs.
- Following this `fo:change-bar-begin` in document order, there must be an `fo:change-bar-end` with which it forms a matching pair. If there is no such `fo:change-bar-end`, it is an error, and the implementation should recover by assuming the equivalent of a matching `fo:change-bar-end` at the end of the document.
- The generated change bar areas run continuously down the start or end edge of the column within the region body.

## Usage Notes

- The `change-bar-class` property assigns a class name to this change bar. The matching `fo:change-bar-end` must use the same class name.
- Change bars can be nested: multiple `fo:change-bar-begin`/`fo:change-bar-end` pairs with the same class can be nested, or different classes can be used for overlapping regions.
- The `change-bar-placement` property controls whether the bar appears on the "start" or "end" edge of the column.
- The `change-bar-style` property specifies the line style (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.).
- The `change-bar-width` property specifies the thickness of the change bar.
- The `change-bar-offset` property specifies the distance between the change bar and the edge of the column.
- The `change-bar-color` property specifies the color of the change bar.
