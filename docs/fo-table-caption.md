# fo:table-caption

## Summary

The `fo:table-caption` formatting object is used to contain block-level formatting objects containing the caption for the table. It is only used when using the `fo:table-and-caption` formatting object.

## Areas

The `fo:table-caption` formatting object generates one or more normal reference-areas. It returns these reference-areas and any page-level-out-of-line areas returned by the children of the `fo:table-caption`.

## Constraints

- For the case when the value of the `caption-side` trait is "before" or "after": the `inline-progression-dimension` of the content-rectangle of the generated reference-area is equal to the `inline-progression-dimension` of the content-rectangle of the reference-area that encloses it.
- When the value is "start" or "end": the `inline-progression-dimension` of the generated reference-area is constrained by the value of the `inline-progression-dimension` trait.
- When the value is "top", "bottom", "left", or "right": the value is mapped in the same way as for corresponding properties (see Computing the Values of Corresponding Properties) and the property is then treated as if the corresponding value had been specified.
- If the caption is to be positioned before the table, the areas generated by the `fo:table-caption` shall be placed in the area tree as though the `fo:table-caption` had a `keep-with-next` property with value "always".
- If the caption is to be positioned after the table, the areas generated by the `fo:table-caption` shall be placed in the area tree as though the `fo:table-caption` had a `keep-with-previous` property with value "always".
- No area may have more than one normal child area returned by the same `fo:table-caption` formatting object.
- The children of each normal area returned by an `fo:table-caption` formatting object must be normal block-areas returned by the children of the `fo:table-caption`, must be properly stacked, and must be properly ordered.
- Any reference-level-out-of-line areas returned by the children of the `fo:table-caption` are handled as described in `fo:float`.

In addition this formatting object may have a sequence of zero or more `fo:marker`s as its initial children.

## Usage Notes

- The `fo:table-caption` must be a child of `fo:table-and-caption`. It cannot be used directly inside `fo:table`.
- The position of the caption relative to the table is controlled by the `caption-side` property on the parent `fo:table-and-caption`.
- When the caption is positioned "before" or "after", its inline-progression-dimension automatically matches the enclosing area. When positioned "start" or "end", use `inline-progression-dimension` (or `width`) to control the caption's size.
- The caption contains block-level content (e.g., `fo:block`).
