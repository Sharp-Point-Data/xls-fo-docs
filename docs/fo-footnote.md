# fo:footnote

## Summary

The `fo:footnote` is typically used to produce footnote-citations within the region-body of a page and the corresponding footnote in a separate area nearer the after-edge of the page.

## Areas

The `fo:footnote` formatting object does not generate any areas. The `fo:footnote` formatting object returns the areas generated and returned by its child `fo:inline` formatting object.

Additionally the `fo:footnote` formatting object returns the block-areas with area class "xsl-footnote" generated by its `fo:footnote-body` child. An area with area-class "xsl-footnote" is placed as a child of a footnote-reference-area.

## Constraints

- The term "anchor-area" is defined to mean the last area that is generated and returned by the `fo:inline` child of the `fo:footnote`.
- A block-area returned by the `fo:footnote` is only permitted as a descendant from a footnote-reference-area that is (a) descendant from a "region-reference-area" generated using the region-master for the region to which the flow that has the `fo:footnote` as a descendant is assigned, and (b) is descendant from the same page that contains the anchor-area, or from a page following the page that contains the anchor-area.
- The second block-area and any additional block-areas returned by an `fo:footnote` must be placed on the immediately subsequent pages to the page containing the first block-area returned by the `fo:footnote`, before any other content is placed. If a subsequent page does not contain a region-body, the user agent must use the region-master of the last page that did contain a region-body to hold the additional block-areas.
- It is an error if the `fo:footnote` occurs as a descendant of a flow that is not assigned to one or more region-body regions, or of an `fo:block-container` that generates absolutely positioned areas. In either case, the block-areas generated by the `fo:footnote-body` child of the `fo:footnote` shall be returned to the parent of the `fo:footnote` and placed in the area tree as though they were normal block-level areas.

## Content Model

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#fo_footnote -->
```xml
(inline,footnote-body)
```

An `fo:footnote` is not permitted to have an `fo:float`, `fo:footnote`, or `fo:marker` as a descendant. Additionally, an `fo:footnote` is not permitted to have as a descendant an `fo:block-container` that generates an absolutely positioned area.

## Usage Notes

- The `fo:footnote` must contain exactly two children: first an `fo:inline` (the footnote citation/marker that appears inline in the text), then an `fo:footnote-body` (the footnote content that appears at the bottom of the page).
- The `fo:inline` child typically contains the footnote reference number or symbol.
- Footnotes cannot be nested: an `fo:footnote` may not contain another `fo:footnote`, `fo:float`, or `fo:marker`.
- If the footnote content does not fit on the page containing the anchor, it will overflow onto subsequent pages.
- The footnote-reference-area where footnote body content is placed is part of the region-body area model, positioned near the after-edge of the page.
