# fo:region-start

## Summary

The `fo:region-start` formatting object is used in constructing an `fo:simple-page-master`. It specifies a viewport/reference pair that is located on the "start" side of the page-reference-area. In lr-tb `writing-mode`, this region corresponds to a left sidebar. The `overflow` trait controls how much of the underlying region-reference-area is visible; that is, whether the region-reference-area is clipped by its parent region-viewport-area.

## Areas

The `fo:region-start` formatting object is used to generate one region-viewport-area and one region-reference-area.

The values of the `padding` and `border-width` traits must be "0".

The start-edge of the content-rectangle of this region-viewport-area is positioned coincident with the start-edge of the content-rectangle of the page-reference-area generated using the parent `fo:simple-page-master`. The `inline-progression-dimension` of the region-viewport-area is determined by the `extent` trait on the `fo:region-start` formatting object.

The `block-progression-dimension` of the region-viewport-area is determined by the `precedence` trait on the adjacent `fo:region-before` and the `fo:region-after`, if these exist; otherwise it is determined as if the value of the `precedence` trait was `false`:
- If the value of the `precedence` trait of the `fo:region-before` (or, respectively, `fo:region-after`) is `false`, then the `block-progression-dimension` extends up to the before- (or, respectively, after-) edge of the content-rectangle of the page-reference-area. In this case, the region-start acts like a float into areas generated by the region-before (respectively, the region-after).
- If the value of the `precedence` trait on the adjacent regions is `true`, then these adjacent regions float into the area generated by the `fo:region-start` and the extent of the `fo:region-start` is effectively reduced by the incursions of the adjacent regions with the value of the `precedence` trait equal to `true`.

The region-reference-area lies on a canvas underneath the region-viewport-area.

The size of the region-reference-area depends on the setting of the `overflow` trait:
- If the value is "auto", "hidden", "error-if-overflow", "paginate", or "visible", the size of the reference-area is the same as the size of the viewport.
- If the value is "scroll", the size of the reference-area is equal to the size of the viewport in the inline-progression-direction in the `writing-mode` for the region and has no constraint in the block-progression-direction (which implies that it grows to hold the distribution of all the content bound to the region).

## Content Model

```
EMPTY
```

The `fo:region-start` has no children. It is an empty element whose properties configure the region.

| writing-mode | lr-tb \| rl-tb \| tb-rl \| tb-lr \| lr \| rl \| tb \| inherit | No | Basic |

## Trait Derivation

The `reference-orientation` and `writing-mode` of the region-viewport-area are determined by the formatting object that generates the area (see `fo:page-sequence`). The `reference-orientation` of the region-reference-area is set to "0" and is therefore the same as the orientation established by the region-viewport-area. The `writing-mode` of the region-reference-area is set to the same value as that of the region-viewport-area.

## Constraints

The constraints on the size and position of the region-reference-area generated using the `fo:region-start` are covered in the "Constraints applicable to regions" section of `fo:simple-page-master`.

## Usage Notes

- The `fo:region-start` is typically used for a sidebar on the start side of the page. In lr-tb writing-mode, this is the left sidebar.
- The `extent` property determines the inline-progression-dimension (width in lr-tb) of this region.
- Unlike `fo:region-before` and `fo:region-after`, the `fo:region-start` does not have a `precedence` property. Instead, its block-progression-dimension is controlled by the `precedence` properties of the adjacent `fo:region-before` and `fo:region-after`.
- The default `region-name` is "xsl-region-start". A custom `region-name` may be specified for use with `fo:static-content` via the `flow-name` property.
- Content is assigned to this region by an `fo:static-content` whose `flow-name` matches the `region-name` of this region.
