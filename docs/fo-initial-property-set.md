# fo:initial-property-set

## Summary

The fo:initial-property-set auxiliary formatting object specifies formatting properties for the first line of an fo:block. It is analogous to the CSS first-line pseudo-element. It does not generate or return any areas. It holds a set of traits that are applicable to the first line-area that has a value of "true" for the is-first trait and that was generated by the parent fo:block.

## Usage Notes

- fo:initial-property-set must be a child of fo:block and must appear before any other children of the fo:block.
- The traits on the fo:initial-property-set are taken into account as traits constraining the first line as if the child inline formatting objects of the fo:block (or parts of them in the case of a line-break) that were used in formatting the first line were enclosed by an fo:inline, as a direct child of the fo:block, with those traits.
- In future versions of the specification, a property controlling the number of lines, or the "depth" that these initial properties apply to, may be added.
- Common use cases include setting the first line of a paragraph in small-caps, applying a different font weight, or changing the text color of the first line.

## Code Samples

The following three-part example from the spec shows how fo:initial-property-set is used to apply small-caps formatting to the first line of a paragraph.

### Source XML input

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#fo_alternative-copyfit-content -->
```xml
<doc>
<p>This is the text of a paragraph that is going to be
presented with the first line in small-caps.</p>
</doc>
```

### XSLT stylesheet using fo:initial-property-set with font-variant="small-caps"

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#fo_alternative-copyfit-content -->
```xml
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
                xmlns:fo="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format"
                version='1.0'>

<xsl:template match="p">
  <fo:block>
    <fo:initial-property-set font-variant="small-caps"/>
    <xsl:apply-templates/>
  </fo:block>
</xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
```

### Resulting XSL-FO output with fo:initial-property-set

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#fo_alternative-copyfit-content -->
```xml
<fo:block>
  <fo:initial-property-set font-variant="small-caps">
  </fo:initial-property-set>This is the text of a paragraph that is going to be
presented with the first line in small-caps.
</fo:block>
```
