# fo:leader

## Summary

The fo:leader formatting object is often used in table-of-contents to generate sequences of "." glyphs that separate titles from page numbers, to create entry fields in fill-in-the-blank forms, and to create horizontal rules for use as separators. It generates and returns a single normal inline-area.

## Content Model

`(#PCDATA | %inline;)*`

The content must not contain an fo:leader, fo:inline-container, fo:block-container, fo:float, fo:footnote, or fo:marker either as a direct child or as a descendant.

## Usage Notes

- If the value of the leader-pattern trait is "use-content", the block-progression-dimension of the content-rectangle is determined in the same manner as for inline-areas; otherwise it is determined by the rule-thickness trait.
- If the leader minimum length is too long to place in the line-area, the leader will begin a new line. If it is too long to be placed in a line by itself, it will overflow the line and potentially overflow the reference-area in accordance with that container's overflow trait.
- The fo:leader can have any inline formatting objects and characters as its children, except that fo:leaders may not be nested. Its children are ignored unless the value of the leader-pattern trait is "use-content".
- If the value of the leader-pattern trait is "use-content" and the fo:leader has no children, the leader shall be filled with blank space.
- The inline-area generated by the fo:leader has a dimension in the inline-progression-direction which shall be at least the leader-length.minimum and at most the leader-length.maximum.
- For line-areas that have been specified to be justified, the justified line-area must honor the leader-alignment trait of any inline-areas generated by fo:leaders.
- If the value of the leader-pattern trait is "dots" or "use-content", the inline-area has as its children the areas returned by children of the fo:leader, or obtained by formatting the pattern specified in the leader-pattern trait, repeated an integral number of times. If the width of even a single repetition is larger than the dimension of the inline-area in the inline-progression-direction, the inline-area shall be filled with blank space.
- If it is desired that the leader should stretch to fill all available space on a line, the maximum length of the leader should be specified to be at least as large as the column width.
- An fo:leader can be wrapped in an fo:block, yielding a block-area with a line-area containing the leader, to create a rule for separating or decorating block-areas.
- The alignment of the leader may be script-specific and may require indicating what alignment point is required.
