# fo:table-and-caption

## Summary

The `fo:table-and-caption` flow object is used for formatting a table together with its caption. It generates one or more normal block-areas containing both the table caption and the table itself, positioned relative to each other as specified by the `caption-side` trait.

An `fo:table-and-caption` may be placed inline by enclosing it in an `fo:inline-container`.

This formatting object corresponds to the CSS anonymous box that encloses the table caption and the table.

## Areas

The `fo:table-and-caption` formatting object generates one or more normal block-areas. It returns these areas, any page-level-out-of-line areas, and any reference-level-out-of-line areas returned by the children of the `fo:table-and-caption`.

## Constraints

- No area may have more than one normal child area returned by the same `fo:table-and-caption` formatting object.
- The children of the areas generated by the `fo:table-and-caption` are one or two areas: one for the table caption and one for the table itself.
- These child areas are positioned relative to each other as specified by the `caption-side` trait.
- They are placed relative to the content-rectangle of the generated area as specified by the `text-align` trait.

## Content Model

```
(fo:table-caption?, fo:table)
```

In addition this formatting object may have a sequence of zero or more `fo:marker`s as its initial children.
