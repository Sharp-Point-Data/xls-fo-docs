# Border, Padding, and Background Properties

## Overview

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#common-border-padding-and-background-properties -->

The common border, padding, and background properties control the visual decoration of areas generated by formatting objects. These properties are taken from CSS2. The border, padding, and background properties that have a `before`, `after`, `start`, or `end` suffix are writing-mode relative and are XSL-only properties. The absolute-direction variants (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) correspond to the CSS2 originals.

This is the largest common property group, applying to most formatting objects that generate block-level or inline-level areas. Writing-mode-relative properties (e.g., `border-before-width`) are preferred over absolute-direction properties (e.g., `border-top-width`) for internationalized documents.

## Properties

### background-attachment

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `scroll \| fixed \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `scroll` |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects that accept common border, padding, and background properties |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#background-attachment -->

CSS2 Definition.

If a background-image is specified, this property specifies whether it is fixed with regard to the viewport (`fixed`) or scrolls along with the document (`scroll`).

- **scroll** -- The background-image may scroll with the enclosing object.
- **fixed** -- The background-image is to be fixed within the viewable area of the enclosing object.

Even if the image is fixed, it is still only visible when it is in the background or padding area of the element. Thus, unless the image is tiled (`background-repeat: repeat`), it may be invisible.

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:** The last paragraph in the CSS description (about conforming HTML user agents) does not apply.

### background-color

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<color> \| transparent \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `transparent` |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects that accept common border, padding, and background properties |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#background-color -->

CSS2 Definition.

This property sets the background color of an element, either a \<color\> value or the keyword `transparent`, to make the underlying colors shine through.

- **transparent** -- The underlying colors will shine through.
- **\<color\>** -- Any valid color specification.

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:** XSL adds an `rgb-icc` function as a valid value of this property.

### background-image

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<uri-specification> \| none \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `none` |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects that accept common border, padding, and background properties |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#background-image -->

CSS2 Definition.

This property sets the background image of an element. When setting a background-image, authors should also specify a background-color that will be used when the image is unavailable. When the image is available, it is rendered on top of the background color. (Thus, the color is visible in the transparent parts of the image.)

- **none** -- No image is specified.
- **\<uri-specification\>** -- A URI-specification identifying the image.

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:** The \<uri\> value has been changed to a \<uri-specification\>.

### background-position-horizontal

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<percentage> \| <length> \| left \| center \| right \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `0%` |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects that accept common border, padding, and background properties |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to the size of the padding-rectangle |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#background-position-horizontal -->

A property derived from a CSS2 property.

If a background-image has been specified, this property specifies its initial position horizontally.

- **\<percentage\>** -- Specifies that a point, at the given percentage across the image from left-to-right, shall be placed at a point at the given percentage across, from left-to-right, the area's padding-rectangle. For example, with a value of 0%, the left-edge of the image is aligned with the left-edge of the area's padding-rectangle. A value of 100% places the right-edge of the image aligned with the right-edge of the padding-rectangle.
- **\<length\>** -- Specifies that the left-edge of the image shall be placed at the specified length to the right of the left-edge of the padding-rectangle.
- **left** -- Same as 0%.
- **center** -- Same as 50%.
- **right** -- Same as 100%.

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:** "Left" and "right" are defined relative to the reference-orientation.

### background-position-vertical

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<percentage> \| <length> \| top \| center \| bottom \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `0%` |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects that accept common border, padding, and background properties |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to the size of the padding-rectangle |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#background-position-vertical -->

A property derived from a CSS2 property.

If a background-image has been specified, this property specifies its initial position vertically.

- **\<percentage\>** -- Specifies that a point, at the given percentage down the image from top-to-bottom, shall be placed at a point at the given percentage down, from top-to-bottom, the area's padding-rectangle. For example, with a value of 0%, the top-edge of the image is aligned with the top-edge of the area's padding-rectangle. A value of 100% places the bottom-edge of the image aligned with the bottom-edge of the padding-rectangle.
- **\<length\>** -- Specifies that the top-edge of the image shall be placed at the specified length below the top-edge of the padding-rectangle.
- **top** -- Same as 0%.
- **center** -- Same as 50%.
- **bottom** -- Same as 100%.

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:** "Top" and "bottom" are defined relative to the reference-orientation.

### background-repeat

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `repeat \| repeat-x \| repeat-y \| no-repeat \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `repeat` |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects that accept common border, padding, and background properties |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#background-repeat -->

CSS2 Definition.

If a background image is specified, this property specifies whether the image is repeated (tiled), and how. All tiling covers the content and padding areas of a box.

- **repeat** -- The image is repeated both horizontally and vertically.
- **repeat-x** -- The image is repeated horizontally only.
- **repeat-y** -- The image is repeated vertically only.
- **no-repeat** -- The image is not repeated: only one copy of the image is drawn.

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:** "Horizontal" and "vertical" are defined relative to the reference-orientation; "horizontal" is "left" to "right", and "vertical" is "top" to "bottom". Thus for a rotated area the tiling is also rotated. It is, however, independent of the writing-mode.

### border-before-color

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<color> \| transparent \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | the value of the 'color' property |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects that accept common border, padding, and background properties |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#border-before-color -->

Writing-mode relative equivalent of a CSS2 property.

Specifies the color of the border on the before-edge of a block-area or inline-area. See definition of property `border-top-color`.

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:** The value "transparent" has been added to be consistent with the definition of the "border-color" shorthand.

### border-before-style

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<border-style> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `none` |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects that accept common border, padding, and background properties |

| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#border-before-width -->

Writing-mode relative equivalent of a CSS2 property.

Specifies the border-width for the before-edge. See definition of property `border-top-width`.

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:** The following value type has been added for XSL:

- **\<length-conditional\>** -- A compound value specifying the width and any conditionality of the border for the before-edge. The `.length` component is a \<length\> (may not be negative). The `.conditionality` component may be set to "discard" or "retain" to control if the border should be 0pt or retained if its associated edge is a leading-edge in a reference-area for areas generated from this formatting object that have an `is-first` value of "false". The initial value of the `.conditionality` component is "discard".

If `border-before-width` is specified using \<length\>, the formatter shall convert the single value to components as follows: `.length` is the resultant computed value of the \<length\>; `.conditional` is "discard". If specified using one of the width keywords, the `.conditional` component is set to "discard" and the `.length` component to a User Agent dependent length.

If the border-style is "none" the computed value of the width is forced to "0pt".

### border-after-color

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<color> \| transparent \| inherit` |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#border-top-color -->

CSS2 Definition.

The 'border-color' property sets the color of the four borders. Values have the following meanings:

- **transparent** -- The border is transparent (though it may have width).
- **\<color\>** -- Any valid color specification.

If an element's border color is not specified with a "border" property, user agents must use the value of the element's "color" property as the computed value for the border color.

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:** The value "transparent" has been added to be consistent with the definition of the "border-color" shorthand.

### border-top-style

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<border-style> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `none` |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects that accept common border, padding, and background properties |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#border-top-style -->

CSS2 Definition (as amended by errata).

The border style properties specify the line style of a box's border (solid, double, dashed, etc.). The \<border-style\> value type may take one of the following:

- **none** -- No border. This value forces the computed value of 'border-width' to be '0'.
- **hidden** -- Same as 'none', except in terms of border conflict resolution for table elements.
- **dotted** -- The border is a series of dots.
- **dashed** -- The border is a series of short line segments.
- **solid** -- The border is a single line segment.
- **double** -- The border is two solid lines. The sum of the two lines and the space between them equals the value of 'border-width'.
- **groove** -- The border looks as though it were carved into the canvas.
- **ridge** -- The opposite of 'groove': the border looks as though it were coming out of the canvas.
- **inset** -- The border makes the entire box look as though it were embedded in the canvas.
- **outset** -- The opposite of 'inset': the border makes the entire box look as though it were coming out of the canvas.

All borders are drawn on top of the box's background. The color of borders drawn for values of 'groove', 'ridge', 'inset', and 'outset' should be based on the element's 'border-color' property, but UAs may choose their own algorithm to calculate the actual colors used.

### border-top-width

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<border-width> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `medium` |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects that accept common border, padding, and background properties |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#border-top-width -->

CSS2 Definition.

The border width properties specify the width of the border area. The \<border-width\> value type may take one of the following values:

- **thin** -- A thin border.
- **medium** -- A medium border.
- **thick** -- A thick border.
- **\<length\>** -- The border's thickness has an explicit value. Explicit border widths cannot be negative.

The interpretation of the first three values depends on the user agent. The following relationships must hold: 'thin' \<= 'medium' \<= 'thick'. Furthermore, these widths must be constant throughout a document.

### border-bottom-color

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<color> \| transparent \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | the value of the 'color' property |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects that accept common border, padding, and background properties |

The initial value of the `.conditionality` component is "discard".

### padding-start

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<padding-width> \| <length-conditional> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `0pt` |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects that accept common border, padding, and background properties |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to width of containing block |

**XSL modifications to the CSS definition:** The following value type has been added for XSL:

- **\<length-conditional\>** -- A compound value specifying the width and any conditionality of the padding for the start-edge. The `.length` component is a \<length\> (may not be negative). The `.conditionality` component may be set to "discard" or "retain" to control if the padding should be 0 or retained if its associated edge is a leading-edge in a line-area for areas generated from this formatting object that have an `is-first` value of "false". The initial value of the `.conditionality` component is "discard".

## Shorthand Mapping Notes

The CSS2 shorthand properties `border`, `border-color`, `border-style`, `border-width`, `border-top`, `border-bottom`, `border-left`, `border-right`, `padding`, and `background` are available in XSL-FO and map to the individual properties listed above. The writing-mode-relative properties (`border-before-*`, `border-after-*`, `border-start-*`, `border-end-*`, `padding-before`, `padding-after`, `padding-start`, `padding-end`) have no shorthand equivalents; each must be set individually.

When both absolute-direction and writing-mode-relative properties are specified on the same formatting object, the writing-mode-relative properties take precedence during property refinement.
