# Common Margin Properties - Block

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#common-margin-properties-block -->

## Overview

The common margin properties for block-level formatting objects control the spacing around and indentation of block areas. This group includes two categories of properties:

1. **Absolute (CSS-compatible) properties:** `margin-top`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`, `margin-right` -- These use absolute directions (top/bottom/left/right) and are provided for CSS compatibility. During property refinement, these are mapped to their writing-mode-relative equivalents.

2. **Relative (XSL-FO native) properties:** `space-before`, `space-after`, `start-indent`, `end-indent` -- These use writing-mode-relative directions (before/after/start/end) and are the preferred way to specify margins in XSL-FO.

**Important:** The absolute `margin-*` properties and the relative `space-*`/`*-indent` properties correspond to each other after refinement. In left-to-right, top-to-bottom writing mode: `margin-top` maps to `space-before`, `margin-bottom` maps to `space-after`, `margin-left` maps to `start-indent`, and `margin-right` maps to `end-indent`. When writing mode changes, the mapping changes accordingly. Use the relative properties (`space-before`, `space-after`, `start-indent`, `end-indent`) for writing-mode-independent stylesheets.

The `space-before` and `space-after` properties use the `<space>` compound datatype with minimum/optimum/maximum components plus conditionality and precedence, giving them richer semantics than simple `margin-top`/`margin-bottom` lengths.

The `start-indent` and `end-indent` properties are inherited and measured from the containing reference-area edge, while `margin-*` properties are not inherited.

## Properties

### end-indent

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<length> \| <percentage> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `0pt` |
| **Applies to** | block-level formatting objects |
| **Inherited** | Yes |
| **Percentages** | refer to inline-progression-dimension of containing reference-area |

For each block-area generated by this formatting object, specifies the distance from the end-edge of the content-rectangle of that block-area to the end-edge of the content-rectangle of the containing reference-area.

Values have the following meanings:

- **\<length\>** -- The "end-indent" is specified as a length.
- **\<percentage\>** -- The "end-indent" is specified as a percentage of the inline-progression-dimension of the containing reference-area.

This property may have a negative value, which indicates an outdent.

### margin-bottom

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<margin-width> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `0pt` |
| **Applies to** | block-level formatting objects |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to width of containing block |

Sets the bottom margin of a box.

Margin-width may be one of the following:

- **auto** -- See the CSS2 section on computing widths and margins for behavior.
- **\<length\>** -- Specifies a fixed width.
- **\<percentage\>** -- The percentage is calculated with respect to the width of the generated box's containing block. This is true for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom', except in the page context, where percentages refer to page box height.

Negative values for margin properties are allowed, but there may be implementation-specific limits.

XSL modifications to the CSS definition: Margin-bottom is provided for compatibility with CSS. Details on the mapping of CSS "margin" properties for XSL are given in the property refinement / resolution section of the spec.

### margin-left

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<margin-width> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `0pt` |
| **Applies to** | block-level formatting objects |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to width of containing block |

Sets the left margin of a box.

Margin-width may be one of the following:

- **auto** -- See the CSS2 section on computing widths and margins for behavior.
- **\<length\>** -- Specifies a fixed width.
- **\<percentage\>** -- The percentage is calculated with respect to the width of the generated box's containing block.

Negative values for margin properties are allowed, but there may be implementation-specific limits.

XSL modifications to the CSS definition: Margin-left is provided for compatibility with CSS. Details on the mapping of CSS "margin" properties for XSL are given in the property refinement / resolution section of the spec.

### margin-right

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<margin-width> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `0pt` |
| **Applies to** | block-level formatting objects |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to width of containing block |

Sets the right margin of a box.

Margin-width may be one of the following:

- **auto** -- See the CSS2 section on computing widths and margins for behavior.
- **\<length\>** -- Specifies a fixed width.
- **\<percentage\>** -- The percentage is calculated with respect to the width of the generated box's containing block.

Negative values for margin properties are allowed, but there may be implementation-specific limits.

XSL modifications to the CSS definition: Margin-right is provided for compatibility with CSS. Details on the mapping of CSS "margin" properties for XSL are given in the property refinement / resolution section of the spec.

### margin-top

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<margin-width> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `0pt` |
| **Applies to** | block-level formatting objects |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to width of containing block |

Sets the top margin of a box.

Margin-width may be one of the following:

- **auto** -- See the CSS2 section on computing widths and margins for behavior.
- **\<length\>** -- Specifies a fixed width.
- **\<percentage\>** -- The percentage is calculated with respect to the width of the generated box's containing block. This is true for 'margin-top' and 'margin-bottom', except in the page context, where percentages refer to page box height.

Negative values for margin properties are allowed, but there may be implementation-specific limits.

XSL modifications to the CSS definition: Margin-top is provided for compatibility with CSS. Details on the mapping of CSS "margin" properties for XSL are given in the property refinement / resolution section of the spec.

### space-after

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<space> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `space.minimum=0pt, .optimum=0pt, .maximum=0pt, .conditionality=discard, .precedence=0` |
| **Applies to** | block-level formatting objects |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A (Differs from margin-bottom in CSS) |

Specifies the value of the space-specifier for the space after the areas generated by this formatting object. A definition of space-specifiers, and the interaction between space-specifiers occurring in sequence are given in the spec section on space resolution.

Values have the following meanings:

- **\<space\>** -- Specifies the minimum, optimum, and maximum values for the space after any areas generated by this formatting object and the conditionality and precedence of this space.

Note: A common example of such a sequence is the "space-after" on one area and the "space-before" of its next sibling.

### space-before

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<space> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `space.minimum=0pt, .optimum=0pt, .maximum=0pt, .conditionality=discard, .precedence=0` |
| **Applies to** | block-level formatting objects |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A (Differs from margin-top in CSS) |

Specifies the value of the space-specifier for the space before the areas generated by this formatting object. A definition of space-specifiers, and the interaction between space-specifiers occurring in sequence are given in the spec section on space resolution.

Values have the following meanings:

- **\<space\>** -- Specifies the minimum, optimum, and maximum values for the space before any areas generated by this formatting object and the conditionality and precedence of this space.

Note: A common example of such a sequence is the "space-after" on one area and the "space-before" of its next sibling.

### start-indent

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<length> \| <percentage> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `0pt` |

For each block-area generated by this formatting object, specifies the distance from the start-edge of the content-rectangle of the containing reference-area to the start-edge of the content-rectangle of that block-area.

Values have the following meanings:

- **\<length\>** -- The "start-indent" is specified as a length.
- **\<percentage\>** -- The "start-indent" is specified as a percentage of the inline-progression-dimension of the containing reference-area.

This property may have a negative value, which indicates an outdent.
