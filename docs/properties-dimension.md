# Area Dimension Properties

## Overview

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#block-progression-dimension -->

The area dimension properties control the dimensions of both block-areas and inline-areas. They include the writing-mode-relative properties "block-progression-dimension" and "inline-progression-dimension", the absolute CSS2 equivalents "height" and "width" with their min/max variants, and properties for controlling the sizing and scaling of replaced content such as external graphics.

In XSL-FO, the absolute properties "height", "width", "max-height", "max-width", "min-height", and "min-width" are mapped to either "inline-progression-dimension" or "block-progression-dimension" during property refinement, based on the applicable values of the "writing-mode" and "reference-orientation" properties.

## Properties

### allowed-height-scale

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `[ any \| <percentage> ]* \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `any` |
| **Applies to** | fo:external-graphic, fo:instream-foreign-object |
| **Inherited** | Yes |
| **Percentages** | intrinsic height |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#allowed-height-scale -->

A sequence of tokens, each specifying an allowed scale-factor value. Tokens have the following meanings:

- **any** -- No constraint on the scale-factor.
- **\<percentage\>** -- Specifies a constraint on the scale-factor to match the specified value.

Specifies a list of constraints on the scale-factor values that may be used when scaling a graphic in the height direction. The list is unordered, except that an "any" value is considered last and is only used if the scaling constraints cannot be satisfied using any of the other specified values.

Note: It is recommended to include "any" in the list for applications where scrolling is not desired or available.

### allowed-width-scale

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `[ any \| <percentage> ]* \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `any` |
| **Applies to** | fo:external-graphic, fo:instream-foreign-object |
| **Inherited** | Yes |
| **Percentages** | intrinsic width |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#allowed-width-scale -->

A sequence of tokens, each specifying an allowed scale-factor value. Tokens have the following meanings:

- **any** -- No constraint on the scale-factor.
- **\<percentage\>** -- Specifies a constraint on the scale-factor to match the specified value.

Specifies a list of constraints on the scale-factor values that may be used when scaling a graphic in the width direction. The list is unordered, except that an "any" value is considered last and is only used if the scaling constraints cannot be satisfied using any of the other specified values.

Note: It is recommended to include "any" in the list for applications where scrolling is not desired or available.

### block-progression-dimension

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `auto \| <length> \| <percentage> \| <length-range> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:block-container, fo:external-graphic, fo:inline, fo:inline-container, fo:instream-foreign-object, fo:table, fo:table-caption, fo:table-cell, fo:table-row |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | see prose |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#block-progression-dimension -->

This property specifies the block-progression-dimension of the content-rectangle for each area generated by this formatting object. The user may specify an explicit size (\<length\> or \<percentage\>) or a \<length-range\>, allowing the size to be adjusted by the formatter.

This property does not apply when the "line-height" property applies to the same dimension of the areas generated by this formatting object.

Values have the following meanings:

- **auto** -- No constraint is imposed by this property. The block-progression-dimension is determined by the formatter taking all other constraints into account. Specifying block-progression-dimension="auto" will set block-progression-dimension.minimum="auto", block-progression-dimension.optimum="auto", and block-progression-dimension.maximum="auto".
- **\<length\>** -- Specifies a fixed block-progression-dimension. Sets all three subcomponents (.minimum, .optimum, .maximum) to the specified length.
- **\<percentage\>** -- Specifies a percentage block-progression-dimension. The percentage is calculated with respect to the corresponding dimension of the closest area ancestor that was generated by a block-level formatting object. If that dimension is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content's block-progression-dimension), the value is interpreted as "auto". Sets all three subcomponents to the specified percentage.
- **\<length-range\>** -- Specifies the dimension as a length-range consisting of block-progression-dimension.optimum (the preferred dimension of the area created), block-progression-dimension.minimum, and block-progression-dimension.maximum. A value of "auto" may be specified for optimum, indicating that there is no preferred dimension. A value of "auto" may be specified for block-progression-dimension.maximum, indicating that there is no absolute maximum limit. Negative values for any subcomponent are invalid and are treated as if "0pt" had been specified. If the value of block-progression-dimension.optimum is "auto" and the computed value of block-progression-dimension.minimum is greater than the computed value of block-progression-dimension.maximum, block-progression-dimension.minimum is treated as if the value of block-progression-dimension.maximum had been specified.

### content-height

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `auto \| scale-to-fit \| scale-down-to-fit \| scale-up-to-fit \| <length> \| <percentage> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:external-graphic, fo:instream-foreign-object |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | intrinsic height |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#content-height -->

Specifies the content-height of some object (e.g., an external graphic). If the value is a percentage, the value of this property is the percentage applied to the intrinsic height.

Values have the following meanings:

- **auto** -- The content-height should be the intrinsic content-height.
- **scale-to-fit** -- The largest scaling-factor permitted will be applied to the content so that the scaled content-height is less than or equal to the height of the viewport.
- **scale-down-to-fit** -- If the intrinsic content-height is less than or equal to the height of the viewport the content-height should be the intrinsic content-height. Otherwise the largest scaling-factor permitted will be applied to the content so that the scaled content-height is less than or equal to the height of the viewport.
- **scale-up-to-fit** -- If the intrinsic content-height is greater than or equal to the height of the viewport the content-height should be the intrinsic content-height. Otherwise the largest scaling-factor permitted will be applied to the content so that the scaled content-height is less than or equal to the height of the viewport.
- **\<length\>** -- An absolute size for the content-height. This value implies a certain scaling factor to be applied onto the content.
- **\<percentage\>** -- A percentage representing a scaling factor for the content-height.

### content-width

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `auto \| scale-to-fit \| scale-down-to-fit \| scale-up-to-fit \| <length> \| <percentage> \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:external-graphic, fo:instream-foreign-object |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | intrinsic width |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#content-width -->

Specifies the content-width of some object (e.g., an external graphic). If the value is a percentage, the value of this property is the percentage applied to the intrinsic width.

Values have the following meanings:

- **auto** -- The content-width should be the intrinsic content-width.
- **scale-to-fit** -- The largest scaling-factor permitted will be applied to the content so that the scaled content-width is less than or equal to the width of the viewport.
- **scale-down-to-fit** -- If the intrinsic content-width is less than or equal to the width of the viewport the content-width should be the intrinsic content-width. Otherwise the largest scaling-factor permitted will be applied to the content so that the scaled content-width is less than or equal to the width of the viewport.
- **scale-up-to-fit** -- If the intrinsic content-width is greater than or equal to the width of the viewport the content-width should be the intrinsic content-width. Otherwise the largest scaling-factor permitted will be applied to the content so that the scaled content-width is less than or equal to the width of the viewport.
- **\<length\>** -- An absolute size for the content-width. This value implies a certain scaling factor to be applied onto the content.
- **\<percentage\>** -- A percentage representing a scaling factor for the content-width.

### height

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<length> \| <percentage> \| auto \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:block-container, fo:external-graphic, fo:inline, fo:inline-container, fo:instream-foreign-object, fo:table, fo:table-caption, fo:table-cell, fo:table-row |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | see prose |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#height -->

This property specifies the content height of boxes generated by block-level and replaced elements.

This property does not apply to non-replaced inline-level elements. The height of a non-replaced inline element's boxes is given by the element's (possibly inherited) "line-height" value.

Values have the following meanings:

- **auto** -- The height depends on the values of other properties.
- **\<length\>** -- Specifies a fixed height.
- **\<percentage\>** -- Specifies a percentage height. The percentage is calculated with respect to the height of the generated box's containing block. If the height of the containing block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content height), the value is interpreted like "auto".

Negative values for "height" are illegal.

XSL modifications: In XSL, this property is mapped to either "inline-progression-dimension" or "block-progression-dimension", based on the applicable values of the "writing-mode" and "reference-orientation" properties. Details on the mapping are given in the refinement section of the spec.

| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | see prose |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#inline-progression-dimension -->

This property specifies the inline-progression-dimension of the content-rectangle for each area generated by this formatting object. The user may specify an explicit size (\<length\> or \<percentage\>) or a \<length-range\>, allowing the size to be adjusted by the formatter.

This property does not apply when the "line-height" property applies to the same dimension of the areas generated by this formatting object.

Values have the following meanings:

- **auto** -- No constraint is imposed by this property. The inline-progression-dimension is determined by the formatter taking all other constraints into account. Sets all three subcomponents (.minimum, .optimum, .maximum) to "auto".
- **\<length\>** -- Specifies a fixed inline-progression-dimension. Sets all three subcomponents to the specified length.
- **\<percentage\>** -- Specifies a percentage inline-progression-dimension. The percentage is calculated with respect to the corresponding dimension of the closest area ancestor that was generated by a block-level formatting object. If that dimension is not specified explicitly, the value is interpreted as "auto". Sets all three subcomponents to the specified percentage.
- **\<length-range\>** -- Specifies the dimension as a length-range consisting of inline-progression-dimension.optimum (the preferred dimension), inline-progression-dimension.minimum, and inline-progression-dimension.maximum. A value of "auto" may be specified for optimum. A value of "auto" may be specified for inline-progression-dimension.maximum, indicating no absolute maximum limit. Negative values for any subcomponent are invalid and are treated as if "0pt" had been specified.

### max-height

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<length> \| <percentage> \| none \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `none` |
| **Applies to** | fo:block-container, fo:external-graphic, fo:inline, fo:inline-container, fo:instream-foreign-object, fo:table, fo:table-caption, fo:table-cell, fo:table-row |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | refer to height of containing block |
| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#max-height -->

These two properties ("max-height" and "min-height") allow authors to constrain box heights to a certain range. Values have the following meanings:

- **none** -- (Only on "max-height") No limit on the height of the box.
- **\<length\>** -- Specifies a fixed maximum computed height.
- **\<percentage\>** -- Specifies a percentage for determining the computed value. The percentage is calculated with respect to the height of the generated box's containing block. If the height of the containing block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content height), the percentage value is interpreted like "none".

| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#scaling-method -->

This property is used to indicate a preference in the scaling/sizing tradeoff to be used when formatting bitmapped graphics.

Values have the following meanings:

- **auto** -- The User Agent is free to choose either resampling, integer scaling, or any other scaling method.
- **integer-pixels** -- The User Agent should scale the image such that each pixel in the original image is scaled to the nearest integer number of device-pixels that yields an image less-than-or-equal-to the image size derived from the content-height, content-width, and scaling properties.
- **resample-any-method** -- The User Agent should resample the supplied image to provide an image that fills the size derived from the content-height, content-width, and scaling properties. The user agent may use any sampling method.

Note: This is defined as a preference to allow the user agent the flexibility to adapt to device limitations and to accommodate over-constrained situations involving min/max dimensions and scale factors.

### width

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<length> \| <percentage> \| auto \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `auto` |
| **Applies to** | fo:block-container, fo:external-graphic, fo:inline, fo:inline-container, fo:instream-foreign-object, fo:table, fo:table-caption, fo:table-cell, fo:table-column |
| **Inherited** | No |

| **Media** | visual |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#width -->

This property specifies the content width of boxes generated by block-level and replaced elements.

This property does not apply to non-replaced inline-level elements. The width of a non-replaced inline element's boxes is that of the rendered content within them (before any relative offset of children). Recall that inline boxes flow into line boxes. The width of line boxes is given by their containing block, but may be shortened by the presence of floats.

The width of a replaced element's box is intrinsic and may be scaled by the user agent if the value of this property is different than "auto".

Values have the following meanings:

- **auto** -- The width depends on the values of other properties.
- **\<length\>** -- Specifies a fixed width.
- **\<percentage\>** -- Specifies a percentage width. The percentage is calculated with respect to the width of the generated box's containing block.

Negative values for "width" are illegal.

XSL modifications: In XSL, this property is mapped to either "inline-progression-dimension" or "block-progression-dimension", based on the applicable values of the "writing-mode" and "reference-orientation" properties. Details on the mapping are given in the refinement section of the spec.
