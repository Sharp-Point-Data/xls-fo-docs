# Accessibility Properties

## Overview

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#common-accessibility-properties -->

The common accessibility properties provide metadata for alternate renderers such as aural readers. These properties allow stylesheets to preserve references back to the original source documents and to convey semantic role information about formatting objects. They apply to nearly all formatting objects and are particularly important for accessible document output.

## Properties

### source-document

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<uri-specification> [<uri-specification>]* \| none \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `none` |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | all |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#source-document -->

This property provides a pointer back to the original XML document(s) used to create the formatting object tree, in accordance with the Dublin Core definition of "Source" ("A Reference to a resource from which the present resource is derived.").

The value is not validated by and has no inherent standardized semantics for any XSL processor.

Values have the following meanings:

- **none** -- The source document is transient, unknown, or unspecified.
- **\<uri-specification\>** -- A URI-specification giving a reference to the (sub)resource used as input to the stylesheet.

W3C Accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.0, ATAG 1.0, and UAAG 1.0) strongly encourage the use of this property either on the `fo:root` or on the first formatting object generated from a given source document.

The URI-specification is useful for alternate renderers (aural readers, etc.) whenever the structure of the formatting object tree is inappropriate for that renderer.

### role

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Values** | `<string> \| <uri-specification> \| none \| inherit` |
| **Initial** | `none` |
| **Applies to** | all formatting objects |
| **Inherited** | No |
| **Percentages** | N/A |
| **Media** | all |

<!-- Source: https://www.w3.org/TR/xslfo20/#role -->

This property provides a hint for alternate renderers (aural readers, etc.) as to the role of the XML element or elements that were used to construct this formatting object, if one could be identified during XSLT tree construction. This information can be used to prepare alternate renderings when the normal rendering of a formatting object is not appropriate or satisfactory; for example, the role information can be used to provide better aural renderings of visually formatted material.

Values have the following meanings:

- **none** -- Indicates that no semantic tag is cited by this formatting object.
- **\<string\>** -- The value is a string representing a semantic identifier that may be used in rendering this formatting object. To aid alternate renderers, the string value should be the qualified name (QName) of the element from which this formatting object is constructed.
- **\<uri-specification\>** -- A URI-specification, indicating an RDF resource; that is, an XML object that is syntactically valid with respect to the RDF grammar. If a QName does not provide sufficient context, the URI-specification can be used to identify an RDF resource that describes the role in more detail. This RDF resource may be embedded in the result tree and referenced with a relative URI or fragment identifier, or it may be external to the result tree.

This property is not inherited, but all subsidiary nodes of this formatting object that do not bear a role property should utilize the same alternate presentation properties. (It is not inherited because knowledge of the start and end of the formatting object subtree generated by the element may be needed by the renderer.)

This specification does not define any standard QName or RDF vocabularies; these are frequently application area dependent. Other groups, for example the Dublin Core, have defined such vocabularies.

## Code Samples
