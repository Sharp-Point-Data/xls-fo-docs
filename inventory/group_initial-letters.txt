### axf:initial-letters

Creates drop initials.

A dropped initial is selected from the first text by tracing the children
of the element for which axf:initial-letters is specified. axf:initial-
letters is ignored if the following elements appear before text:
‒
<fo:block> with axf:initial-letters specified
‒
<fo:block> within inline elements
‒
Block elements other than <fo:block>
‒
<fo:inline-container>
‒
<fo:bidi-override>
‒
<fo:page-number>
‒
<fo:page-number-citation>
‒
<fo:page-number-citation-last>
‒
<axf:footnote-number>
‒
<axf:footnote-number-citation>
Values have the following meanings:
‒
normal: Does nothing.
‒
<number>: Specifies the letter size of a dropped initial by number of
lines. When the value is less than 1, it is invalid.
‒
<length>: Specifies the letter size of a dropped initial by actual di‐
mensions. The specified dimension is converted to how many lines
it corresponds to. When it is less than 1 line, it is invalid.
‒
<integer>: Specifies the number of lines a dropped initial should
sink. When the value is omitted, it is considered a value obtained by
rounding down the number of lines to an integer. When the value is
less than 1, it is invalid.
‒
drop: Equivalent to specifying a value of the number of lines roun‐
ded down to an integer to <integer>.
‒
raise: Equivalent to specifying 1 to <integer>.
‒
adjacent: Indents all lines in the block, not just the letter of a drop‐
ped initial.

‒
<integer2>: Similar to adjacent, but indents the lines after the part of
dropped initial by the specified number of lines. When the value is
omitted, it is considered 0. When the value is negative, it is invalid.
A float with axf:float-x="start" within the number of lines of the
dropped initial is placed on the start side of the dropped initial when
its anchor is included at the start of the block. Otherwise, it will be
pushed out and placed on the after side of the dropped initial. ☞

### axf:initial-letters-first-line-head-height

Specifies where the height of a dropped initial should be adjusted.
CAUTION: This property is not effective when the document is vertical

Values have the following meanings:
‒
cap-height: Adjusts the height to cap-height on the first line. For an
illustrated example, see axf:initial-letters-first-line-head-height in
the Online Manual.
‒
x-height: Adjusts the height to x-height on the first line. For an
illustrated example, see axf:initial-letters-first-line-head-height in
the Online Manual.
‒
auto: Adjusts the height to x-height under the following conditions:

•
When the next character of a dropped initial character or image
is lowercase small-caps (provided that the character or image to
be a dropped initial and the next character belong to the same
element).
•
When the number of lines of a dropped initial is equal to the
number of lines a dropped initial should sink (provided that the
number of lines is specified without units).
Otherwise, adjusts to cap-height.
Applies to: <fo:block>
Values: cap-height | x-height | auto
Initial: auto
Inherited: yes

### axf:initial-letters-leading-punctuation

Specifies the size of the leading punctuation of a dropped initial, etc.
Values have the following meanings:
‒
normal: Does nothing special.

Specifies the position of the leading punctuation of a dropped initial in
the inline progression direction.
Values have the following meanings:
‒
normal: Does nothing special.
‒
hang: Protrudes the leading punctuation to the start side.
axf:hanging-punctuation="start" protrudes one-character punctuation,
but the hang setting protrudes all punctuations.
‒
intrude: Penetrates and overlaps the leading punctuation with the
dropped initial.
‒
<length>: Adjusts the position of the leading punctuation. hang or
intrude must be specified. Shifts the punctuation from that position
by the specified length in the inline progression direction.
Applies to: <fo:block>
Values: normal | [[hang | intrude] && <length>?]
Initial: normal
Inherited: yes

### axf:initial-letters-leading-punctuation-shift

Specifies the position of the leading punctuation of a dropped initial in
the block progression direction.
Values have the following meanings:
‒
normal: Does nothing special. Aligns the leading punctuation with
the baseline for horizontal writing and aligns it with the center for
vertical writing.

‒
baseline: Aligns the leading punctuation with the baseline of the last
line.
‒
before: Aligns the leading punctuation with the before side of the
dropped initial.
‒
middle: Aligns the leading punctuation with the center of the drop‐
ped initial.
‒
after: Aligns the leading punctuation with the after side of the
dropped initial.
‒
<length>: Specifies the baseline-shift amount of the leading punctua‐
tion. If it is specified at the same time as baseline, before, middle, and
after, it is the shift amount from that position.
Applies to: <fo:block>
Values: normal | [[baseline | before | middle | after] || <length>]
Initial: normal
Inherited: yes

### axf:initial-letters-start-intrusion

Specifies the alignment of a float on the start side of the dropped initial.
Applies to: <fo:block>
Values: none | first-line
Initial: none
Inherited: yes
Values have the following meanings:
‒
none: Aligns the float on the after side, avoiding the dropped initial.
‒
first-line: If the anchor of the <fo:float> is after the dropped initial
and at the start line of the block, aligns the float on the start side of
the dropped initial. If this is not the case, aligns it on the after side,
avoiding the dropped initial. However, if the following conditions
are not met, it is considered axf:initial-letters-start-intrusion="no‐
ne" and aligned on the after side.

•
When axf:float-x is other than none
•
When axf:float-wrap is wrap
Specifies the alignment of a float when the anchor of the float, that
has axf:float-x="start" and is included in the block with dropped
initial specified, exists after the dropped initial. A float with an
anchor before the dropped initial will be aligned on the start side
regardless of this setting.
This property is not effective when intrusion-displace="block" is spe‐
cified, because floats are always aligned outside the block.

### axf:initial-letters-text-align

Specifies the alignment of a dropped initial.
When the value of axf:initial-letters-width is auto, it has no effect
because there is no room for right alignment.

Initial: end

Inherited: yes

### axf:initial-letters-width

Specifies the width of a dropped initial.
