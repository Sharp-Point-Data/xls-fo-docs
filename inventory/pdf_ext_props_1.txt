AHF Extensions: Properties
The extension properties are sorted alphabetically. After a short descrip‐
tion of the function, the allowed environments are enumerated in which
the given property may be used.
After that, the possible property values and the default setting are
named. The default sets the behavior of the AH XSL formatter when the
given property is not specified. Values delimited by <> render property
value formats (see the explanations in section ).
Finally, whether the specified property value inherits in the XML hie‐
rarchy or not is specified.
The detailed function descriptions and examples for the application are
taken from the AHF Online Manual. For some properties, further applica‐
tion details and examples are given in the AHF Online Manual.

Values have the following meanings:
auto: The value specified by abbreviation-character-count in the Option
Setting File is adopted.
<number>: Specifies the number of characters considered an abbreviation.
Applies to: <fo:block>
Values: auto | <number>
Initial: auto
Inherited: yes
axf:action-type 
This extension is used to set the behavior of an external hyperlink or
form action.
The goto value causes an internal link, gotor causes a link into a PDF
document. launch opens the target as a file. uri opens the target as a
URI (on the web). The reset and submit values can only be used for
the <axf:form-field> extension object. reset resets a form field, submit
dispatches a form field as a form action. The javascript value triggers
a JavaScript action. The default value auto triggers a system specific
action.
If the link does not target a local file, the action type is always URI.
If the action type is unspecified or set to the default auto, the target
specified by a relative addressing is treated according to the setting
of use-launch-for-relative-uri in the AH XSL Formatter PDF Output
Settings either as action type Open the file (for value true) or as World
Wide Web link (for value false). For an absolute address, the action type
is always World Wide Web link.
A more detailed description of PDF link behavior can be found in the
AH XSL Formatter Online Manual (file: ahf-ext.html#axf.action-type).
Applies to: <fo:basic-link>, <axf:form-field>, <axf:form-field-event>

axf:assumed-page-number 
Specifies the assumed page number. When <fo:page-number-citation>
appears, the reference area is sometimes undecided. In evaluation of
fo:page-number-citation, the temporary area is secured first, and when
a page number is decided, it is adjusted to the right contents. Since
the size of an area may change at this time, the formatted result is
sometimes not desirable. For example, when an area becomes narrow,
it seems that there is an unnecessary line break, and condition that
a character will overflow if an area becomes large appears. axf:assumed-
page-number gives the assumed page number at that time.

axf:float 
This is a shorthand property for setting float related extension
properties: axf:float-x, axf:float-y, axf:float-reference, axf:float-move,
axf:float-wrap.
Values have the following meanings:
‒
<float-x> = none | start | end | left | right | top | bottom | center
| inside | outside | alternate | column-outside
Specifies horizontal (or vertical if writing-mode is vertical) float
alignment. ☞ axf:float-x
‒
<float-y> = none | before | after | top | bottom | left | right |
center | inside | outside
Specifies vertical (or horizontal if writing-mode is vertical) float
alignment. ☞ axf:float-y
‒
<float-wrap> = wrap | skip
Specifies whether the text wraps around the float. ☞ axf:float-wrap
‒
<float-reference> = auto | normal | page | multicol | column

Specifies reference area where the float is positioned. ☞
axf:float-reference
‒
<float-move> = next | auto-next | auto-move | keep | keep-float |
<integer>
Specifies whether the float moves to the next page (or column). ☞
axf:float-move
An example of the use of this shorthand property can be found in Float
Extension in Features of the Online Manual.
The values left, right, top, bottom, center, inside, and outside which
express absolute directions have the ambiguity to extend to both <float-
x> and <float-y>. This can be solved as follows:
‒
none is ignored.
‒
When one of before, after, start, end, alternate or column-outside is
contained, either <float-x> or <float-y> will be selected. The remai‐
ning ambiguous value will become another value.
‒
When none of before, after, start, end, alternate or column-outside is
contained, the first value which expresses the absolute direction will
be <float-x>, the latter value will be <float-y>.

auto-next: The float is moved to the next page (or column) if there is
not enough space in the current page (or column).
‒
auto-move: The float is moved to the next page (or column) if there is
not enough space in the current page (or column). It is also possible
that the float anchor and around text are moved to the next page (or
column) instead.
‒
keep: The float and its anchor are always placed on the same page
(or column). If there is not enough space for that, a page (or co‐
lumn) break occurs before the float anchor and a blank space is left.
‒
keep-float: Although it is almost the same as keep, the following
points differ. With keep, keep-with-next="always" is automatically set
to anchor area and a page break (or column break) is deterred
between the next area. However, it is not performed by keep-float.
The difference on operation will appear when the height of anchor
area is zero.
‒
after-edge: Aligns the bottom edge of the float with the position of
the anchor when axf:float-y is none.
‒
<integer>: The numerical value is considered the page number and
moves the float to that page. If it is larger than the number of pages
in the document, pages with no contents (not blank pages) will be
inserted. It does not work when axf:float-y is none. At that time, it is
considered that auto is specified. (New in V7.1)
CAUTION: Page numbers are considered logical page numbers.

When the axf:float-y value is not none and there is remaining space to
place the text before or after the float within the formatting target area,
if the extent of that space is smaller than the extent specified by this
property, the text is not placed to that space.
If the value of axf:float-y is none, it is processed as follows:
‒
If the value of axf:float-move is auto-next and there is space left to
place text after the float within the formatting target area, if its
height (width in vertical writing) is smaller than the height (width
in vertical writing) specified in this property, moves the float posi‐
tion so that its height (width in vertical writing) becomes zero. Text
that was after the float will move before the float.
‒
If the value of axf:float-move is auto-move, it is the same as the case of
auto-next, but within the formatting target area, if the height (width
in vertical writing) of the text placement space before the float, not
only after the float, is smaller than the height (width in vertical
writing) specified in this property, moves the float position so that
its height (width in vertical writing) becomes zero. Text that was
before the float will move after the float.
‒
If the value of axf:float-move is other than these, text will wrap
around if there is space left to place text after the float in the
formatting target area, otherwise it will not wrap around.

‒
all: latin kana jamo is considered to be specified.
‒
auto: The ligature of kana is performed. latin-ligature in the Option
Setting File will decide whether to perform the ligature of Western
words. This setting can also be done with the Format Option Setting
dialog in GUI. Whether to process the ligature of Hangul Jamo
depends on jamo-ligature in the Option Setting File.

axf:line-break 
Specifies the method of line breaking.
Values have the following meanings:
‒
auto: It is assumed that normal is specified.
‒
normal: CJK Nonstarter characters (prolonged sound mark, small
hiragana letters, small katakana letters, and iteration marks) defined
in JIS X 4051:2004 are not treated as Nonstarter characters. Charac‐
ters marked with [NS] in the following list are processed.
‒
strict: CJK Nonstarter character is treated. Characters marked with
[NS] and [JIS] in the following list are processed.
‒
line: Line breaking is performed one by one by a simple algorithm.
‒
bpil: Line breaking is performed according to the line breaking
algorithm by Knuth-Plass's Breaking Paragraphs into Lines. At this
time, the bpil specification in the Option Setting File is ignored.
Depending on the conditions, this algorithm may not be applicable.
See Line Breaking in Technical Notes in Technical of the Online
Manual.
If neither normal nor strict is specified, it is assumed that normal is
specified. When neither line nor bpil is specified, the algorithm is
selected according to the specification of bpil in the Option Setting File.
For more details, see Line Breaking in Technical Notes in Technical of
the Online Manual.
The line breaking other than Nonstarter characters in CJK complies
with UAX#14: Line Breaking Properties. At this time, characters
specified to the properties of axf:append-non-starter-characters,
axf:except-non-starter-characters, axf:append-non-end-of-line-characters
and axf:except-non-end-of-line-characters are included.
