### axf:tab-align

Specifies the tab alignment at the tab stop position.
‒
With the default value auto, the alignment follows the setting in
axf:tab-stops in the parent block (<fo:block>).
‒
start aligns the start of the string to the tab stop position.
‒
center aligns the center of the string to the tab stop position.
‒
end aligns the end of the string to the tab stop position.
‒
left aligns the left side of the string (the top of the string in case of
vertical writing) to the tab stop position. Same as start above in case
of writing-mode="lr-tb" and "tb-rl".

‒
right aligns the right side of the string (the bottom of the string in
case of vertical writing) to the tab stop position. Same as end above
in case of writing-mode="lr-tb" and "tb-rl".
‒
bei decimal, considered that "." is specified.
‒
<string> aligns the start of the string to the tab stop position as
specified.
Applies to: <axf:tab>
Values: auto | start | center | end | left | right | decimal | <string>
Initial: auto
Inherited: no

### axf:tab-overlap-treatment

Specifies a behavior when tab alignment makes letters overlapped. The
default value auto depends on the default value of the system. This is
the value specified in tab-overlap-treatment in the Option Setting File.
The value ignore-tab ignores the tab. The string will be shown just after
the previous string. The value next-tab places the tab at the next tab
stop position. Letters will not be overlapped when axf:tab-align="start"
is specified.
Applies to: <fo:block>, <fo:character>
Values: auto | ignore-tab | next-tab
Initial: auto
Inherited: yes

### axf:tab-stops

This property is used to specify both the tab stops and the alignment
of the content at the tab stop positions of the block lines in blocks
(<fo:block>). These specifications are inherited by any subordinate
blocks! For each tab stop, the alignment at the tab stop is set first,
then the tab stop position (tab width) itself. All values are separated
by spaces. If the alignment value is missing, the alignment value of the
preceding tab stop position is assumed. If the alignment value at the
beginning of the line is missing, then the start value applies. For the
available alignment values, see axf:tab-align.
The tab width is set either by a length value (<length>) or a number
(<number>). The number value corresponds to the number of spaces
(U-0020). The default is eight spaces (8).
The eol value is the tab stop position at the end of a line. If this value
is missing, then the last defined tab width is repeated to the end of the
line.
Applies to: practically useful in <fo:block>
Values: [[<tab-align>? [<length>|<number>]]* [<tab-align>? eol]?]!

Initial: 8
Inherited: yes

### axf:tab-treatment

Specifies the method to treat the tab character (U+0009). The value
<number> means the specified number of the white space characters
(U+0020). You cannot specify a negative value. This white space is subject
to processing of white-space-treatment and white-space-collapse, etc. The
value preserve means treated as <axf:tab>.
Applies to: <fo:block>, <fo:character>
Values: <number> | preserve
Initial: 4
Inherited: yes
