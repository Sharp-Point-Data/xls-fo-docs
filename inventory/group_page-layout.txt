### axf:bleed-top

Specifies the width of the bleed area for cutting off.
The area of the bleed is taken outside the trim size. In order to specify
the same values vertically and horizontally, axf:bleed can be used.
In order to specify individual values, axf:bleed-top, axf:bleed-bottom,
axf:bleed-left and axf:bleed-right can be used. When axf:bleed and
others are specified simultaneously, individual axf:bleed-* properties
take priority.
Applies to: <fo:simple-page-master>
Values: <length>
Initial: 0pt
Inherited: no

### axf:crop-area-visibility

Specifies whether to display the area that is extended beyond the trim
size. Specifies whether the area that overflows on the margin specified
with axf:crop-offset is clipped with the trim size, if there is a bleed
area, clipped with the bleed area, or the extended area is displayed.

### axf:crop-offset-top

Specifies the distance from the physical end to the trim size of the
output medium.

The trim size is specified by the page-width and page-height properties.
axf:crop-offset is for specifying how much the space is taken outside
the trim size. In order to specify the same values vertically and
horizontally, axf:crop-offset can be used. In order to specify individual
values, axf:crop-offset-top, axf:crop-offset-bottom, axf:crop-offset-left
and axf:crop-offset-right can be used. When axf:crop-offset and others
are specified simultaneously, individual axf:crop-offset-* properties
take priority.
CAUTION: If the value of axf:bleed is greater than the value of
axf:crop-offset, axf:crop-offset is adjusted to that value. To make the
trim size the size of the basic printing image, set axf:bleed and axf:crop-
offset to 0.
Applies to: <fo:simple-page-master>
Values: <length>
Initial: 0pt
Inherited: no
