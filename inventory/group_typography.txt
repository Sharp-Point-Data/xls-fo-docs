### axf:normalize

Specifies the normalization of text.

Normalization Forms is performed. The normalization is performed
to the character strings described in the text area. If you use only

for practical use.
In these conversions, all the Composition Exclusions are excluded
from the normalization processing when axf:normalize-exclude="full-
composition-exclusion" is specified.

FO, will be transformed to U+0020, etc. by performing the normalization
with NFKC, for example.
Values have the following meanings:
‒
auto: Depends on the value of normalize specified to the Option
Setting File.
‒
none: Does not normalize text.

dolor sit amet,
Specifying the property to characters other than quotation marks is
