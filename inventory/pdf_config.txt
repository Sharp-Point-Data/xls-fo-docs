Extensions in the Antenna House
XSL Formatter
SHORT and TIGHT
The following sections cover system and option settings in the AH
XSL Formatter, extension objects, extension properties, extended value
ranges, and other extensions.
To use the Antenna House extensions, the corresponding namespace
must be added to the namespace declarations for XSLT (xsl:) and XSL-FO
(fo:) as follows:
.............................................................................
xmlns:axf="http://www.antennahouse.com/names/XSL/Extensions"
.............................................................................
2.1 
AHF System Settings and Options
The AH XSL Formatter's system settings for formatting properties, font
specifications, auxiliary systems, and output options are open and compre‐
hensively documented. These system settings can be customized by the
user to meet specific requirements. The following is an overview for the
customization options.

The configuration for the formatter with the user-settings are summari‐
zed in the file AHFSettings.xml. All details for editing this file can be found
in the Online Manual of the AH XSL Formatter under the title "Option
Setting File" (ahf-optset.html). The descriptions of Antenna House's own
constructs are taken from the Online Manual for the AH XSL Formatter.

Specify whether to strictly check the syntax of the value of font-family.
When strict is specified, it is evaluated exactly as Font family: the

When formatting a huge document with a large amount of unresolved

parameter solves that problem by making the formatting two passes.

information which should be solved will consume the memory and
the memory consumption will be extremely decreased. This setting

<unbreakable-words> 
Lists the unbreakable words by the line break. The character string
of each line will become unbreakable. For example, if you write as
follows, two phrases will become unbreakable:
<unbreakable-words>
こんにちは
Hello World
</unbreakable-words>
The leading and trailing white spaces (U+0009, U+0020) will be discarded.
Consecutive white spaces (U+0009, U+0020) are grouped together and
match consecutive white spaces (U+0009, U+000A, U+000D, U+0020) including
line breaks. So taking the above example, any of the following will
become unbreakable:
Hello World
Hello    World
Hello
World
Because the first phrase found from the beginning of the character
string is the target, if
ABCD
CDEF
is specified, ABCD will be unbreakable for the character string of
ABCDEFG. Since it is case sensitive, Abcd, etc. will not become
unbreakable. Also, as AH Formatter tries to adopt as long a phrase

This processing is performed for character string of input XML.
In other words, it is performed before processing axf:normalize or

<font-alias> 
Formats the font name src (source) appearing in FO by replacing with
dst (destination). This is achieved by specifying an arbitrary font name
for src and dst. This makes it possible to substitute an unknown font
in a document made in a different environment, without modifying the
document. However, in the following sample:
<font-alias src="A" dst="B">
<font-alias src="B" dst="C">
“A” would never be replaced with “C”. Moreover, the setting for <font-
alias> doesn't affect the font name in the Option file.

XSLT Settings
<xslt-settings> 
These settings are used for XSLT Processor.
Parent: <formatter-config>
Attributes: msxml, msxmlver, command, param-option
Childs: <param>, <stylesheet>, <msxml>
msxml
Specifies whether to use MSXML or not. If true is specified, MSXML
is used as an XSLT Processor. Specification of command is disregarded at
this time. If false is specified, the external XSLT Processor specified
from command will be used, but when nothing is specified from command,
it is considered that true is specified and MSXML is used. The version
of MSXML actually used can be checked in the GUI on the XSLT
page of the Format Option Setting Dialog. This setting is ignored in
non-Windows environment.
Applies to: <xslt-settings>
Values: true | false
Default: true
msxmlver
Specifies the maximum version of MSXML used internally when
msxml="true" is specified. Any version from 6 to 3 can be specified.
For example, when 5 is specified, AH Formatter searches MSXML in
order of MSXML5 → MSXML4 → MSXML3 and adopts the first found
MSXML. If nothing is specified or the specified value is incorrect (such
as 0), the version will be considered 6. This setting is effective only with
Windows version.
Applies to: <xslt-settings>

Values: true | false
Default: 0
command
The command line of the External XSLT Processor is specified here. The
command line strings must include at least three identifiers, %1, %2 and
%3.
‒
%1: XML document
‒
%2: XSL stylesheet
‒
%3: XSLT Output File
‒
%param: Parameter of xsl:param
If nothing is specified, or “@MSXML” is specified, the external processor
is not used but the internal processor, MSXML is used. This setting
is effective only with Windows version. It's an initial setting of XSLT
Processor with all kinds of interfaces. If nothing is specified in non-
Windows environment, XSLT transformation is not performed.
Applies to: <xslt-settings>
Values: a command line for the XSLT processor
Default: none
param-option
Specifies the parameter type of xsl:param given to the external XSLT
Processor. The strings must include at least two identifiers, %p and %v.
These values are as follows:
‒
%p: Value of name of <param>
‒
%v: Value of value of <param>
These values affect the part of %param in the command strings. When two
or more <param>s are specified, they are divided by the white space and
repeated.

Specifies the parameter name of xsl:param for XSLT Processor.

value
Specifies the parameter value of xsl:param for XSLT Processor. When
the value includes a white space, since the quotation marks will not be
processed, explicitly enclose in quotation marks.
Applies to: <param>
Values: see above
Default: none
<stylesheet>
Parent: <xslt-settings>
Attributes: ns, href
ns
href
Possible to specify the stylesheet applied to a specific XML document.
Specifies the name space of the XML document by ns, and specifies

the URI of the stylesheet by href. The following shows the example of
XHTML and WordML:
<stylesheet ns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="xhtml2fo.xsl"/>
<stylesheet ns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/word/2003/wordml"
   href="[WordMLToFO install directory]/WordMLToFO.xsl"/>
If the XML document has the name space specified here, it can be
formatted by itself, without specifying the stylesheet. If the stylesheet
is specified when formatting or the stylesheet is specified in the XML
document, these are adopted and the setting here will be ignored.
Applies to: <stylesheet>
Values: see above
Default: none
<msxml>
Parent: <xslt-settings>
Attributes: name, value
name
value
Specifies the property of MSXML when msxml="true" is specified. The
property name is specified by name and the value is specified by value.
For the moment, only true or false can be specified as value. That is,
the property which needs the other value cannot be specified. There are
two types of properties available.
‒
Properties specified by the setProperty() method like,
setProperty("AllowXsltScript", true);.
‒
Properties specified by the value directly like,
resolveExternals = true;.

‒
validateOnParse
‒
resolveExternals
In any case other than these, the value is set via the setProperty()
method. The character string of name is not checked. It is considered that
the following are set as default:
<msxml name="preserveWhiteSpace" value="true"/>
<msxml name="validateOnParse" value="false"/>
<msxml name="resolveExternals" value="true"/>
<msxml name="ServerHTTPRequest" value="true"/>
<msxml name="ProhibitDTD" value="false"/>>
<msxml name="AllowDocumentFunction" value="true"/>
<msxml name="AllowXsltScript" value="false"/>
From MSXML6.0, resolveExternals became ResolveExternals (AH
Formatter V7.2 accepts both). Also, the default value of this is false
when external-entity="false" is specified.
See also MSXML Security Overview. The settings are ignored with
non-Windows versions.
Applies to: <msxml>
Values: see above
Default: none
Suppose XSLT setting is as follows:
.............................................................................
<xslt-settings command="xslt -o &#34;%3&#34; &#34;%1&#34; &#34;%2&#34;
%param" param-option="%p=%v">
   <param name="foo" value="123"/>
   <param name="bar" value="&#34;Hello, World&#34;"/>

XSLT Processor executes as follows in order to transform file.xml and
file.xsl into file.fo:
.............................................................................
xslt -o "file.fo" "file.xml" "file.xsl" foo=123 bar="Hello, World"
.............................................................................
As described in the example here, the actual file name given to %1 or %2
includes white space, it's necessary to enclose the file name with quotation
mark, “&#34;”.
