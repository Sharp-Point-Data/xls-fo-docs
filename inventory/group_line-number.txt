In this table, line numbers specified to <fo:page-sequence> are given to
the left column and line numbers specified to <fo:table-column id="c2">
are given to the right column independently. In the following table, if
you specify as follows:
   <fo:table>

      <fo:table-body>
      ...
      </fo:table-body>
   </fo:table>
then, line numbers of the right column will continue in sequence from
the previous table.
