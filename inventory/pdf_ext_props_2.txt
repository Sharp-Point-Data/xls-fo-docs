progression direction and the block progression direction. There is
a difference in the condensing process between inline and block.
Inline condensing process occurs by specifying <fo:inline-container>,
and block condensing process occurs by specifying <fo:block-container>.
For example, if there is an absolute value setting such as
font-size="20pt" internally, the size setting will not be changed by
the condensing process with font-size. The same is true for other font-
stretch and line-height.
text-align-last="justify" may be set when the condensing
process by font-size or font-stretch in a block occurs. See
axf:condensed-text-align-last.
You can specify multiple methods, such as ="font-size font-stretch".
In this example, if condensing process by font-size does not resolve
the overflow, condensing process by font-stretch will continue to be
attempted.
Values have the following meanings:
‒
font-size: Condenses the text by adjusting the font size.
‒
font-stretch: Condenses the text by adjusting the font width.
‒
line-height: Condenses the text by adjusting the line height. There is
no condensing process that makes line-height negative.
‒
letter-spacing: Condenses the text by adjusting the letter spacing.
CAUTION: Condensing process by specifying letter-spacing may
cause overlapping characters. The display position of characters
may also be reversed. We recommend that you avoid extreme con‐
densing process with axf:overflow-condense-limit-letter-spacing.
‒
auto: It is considered font-size for the condensing process in the
block, font-stretch for the condensing process in inline.

the inline element and is not inherited.

axf:tab-stops 
This property is used to specify both the tab stops and the alignment
of the content at the tab stop positions of the block lines in blocks
(<fo:block>). These specifications are inherited by any subordinate
blocks! For each tab stop, the alignment at the tab stop is set first,
then the tab stop position (tab width) itself. All values are separated
by spaces. If the alignment value is missing, the alignment value of the
preceding tab stop position is assumed. If the alignment value at the
beginning of the line is missing, then the start value applies. For the
available alignment values, see axf:tab-align.
The tab width is set either by a length value (<length>) or a number
(<number>). The number value corresponds to the number of spaces
(U-0020). The default is eight spaces (8).
The eol value is the tab stop position at the end of a line. If this value
is missing, then the last defined tab width is repeated to the end of the
line.
Applies to: practically useful in <fo:block>
Values: [[<tab-align>? [<length>|<number>]]* [<tab-align>? eol]?]!
