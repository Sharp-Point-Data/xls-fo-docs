script
Specifies the script codes for multilingual setting. The available scripts
conform to ISO 15924. However, the AH Formatter V7.2 does not
support all scripts. The scripts that can be specified here are scripts
that are indicated in Scripts and Languages in the Overview of the

<font-alias> 
Formats the font name src (source) appearing in FO by replacing with
dst (destination). This is achieved by specifying an arbitrary font name
for src and dst. This makes it possible to substitute an unknown font
in a document made in a different environment, without modifying the
document. However, in the following sample:
<font-alias src="A" dst="B">
<font-alias src="B" dst="C">
“A” would never be replaced with “C”. Moreover, the setting for <font-
alias> doesn't affect the font name in the Option file.
