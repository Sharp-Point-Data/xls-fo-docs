distiller: Use Adobe Distiller in the environment where Adobe
Distiller is installed. acrodist.exe is used. Effective only with the
Windows version. PS support at this time has a little restrictions.
•
PS-Adobe-2.0 or later required.
•
%%BeginProlog and %%EndProlog should be included.
☞ joboptions
‒
ghostscript: Use Ghostscript in the environment where Ghosts‐
cript is installed. Use gswin32c.exe with the Windows version (use
gswin64c.exe with Windows 64-bit) and use gs with non-Windows.
Since the program is invoked by fork() etc. and used, there is no
problem with GPL license.
☞ ghostscript
Invalid in the environment where each processor is not installed.
Moreover, it's necessary to set the PATH etc. of the program to use.
Applies to: <pdf-settings>
Values: none | ghostscript | distiller
Default: none
ghostscript 
When converting EPS into PDF using Ghostscript, the full path to
Ghostscript can be specified. For example, specify as ghostscript="/usr/
local/bin/gs". Thereby, Ghostscript can be invoked even if the PATH
does not set to Ghostscript. Specify gswin32c.exe in Windows version
(specify gswin64c.exe with Windows 64-bit).
Applies to: <pdf-settings>
Values: path to Ghostscript program

gs-options
When converting EPS into PDF using Ghostscript, AH Formatter V7.2
specifies the following parameters and starts Ghostscript by default:
-dPDFSETTINGS=/printer
-dNOPAUSE
-dBATCH
-dSAFER
-sDEVICE=pdfwrite
-dDEVICEWIDTHPOINTS=%width
-dDEVICEHEIGHTPOINTS=%height
-dEPSFitPage
-dCompatibilityLevel=1.3
-dAutoRotatePages=/None
-q
-sOutputFile=%temp
-c
.setpdfwrite
-f
%eps
The next four starting with % are replaced by their respective values by
AH Formatter V7.2.
‒
%width: Width of EPS
‒
%height: Height of EPS
‒
%eps: Input EPS
‒
%temp: Temporary Output File
You can specify any parameter with gs-options. Specify multiple
parameters separated by U+000A. The gs-options setting completely
replaces the above settings and launches Ghostscript. The setting of
-sOutputFile is always considered to be -sOutputFile=%temp. If %temp is not
included, it will be added. If %eps is not included, it will be added at

specified.
Applies to: <pdf-settings>
Values: if necessary, other parameters, separated by the character
U+000A.
Default: none
import-annotation-types
Annotations contained in the embedded PDF is embeddable directly
in PDF. Specify the following character strings (case insensitive)
separated by white spaces:
All | Text | Link | FreeText | Line | Square | Circle | Polygon | PolyLine |
Highlight | Underline | Squiggly | StrikeOut | Stamp | Caret | Ink | Popup |
FileAttachment | Sound | Movie | Screen | 3D | RichMedia | Other
Specify Other when you embed annotations with no type written.
When All is specified, all the annotations are embedded. In GUI, it
can be specified by selecting the Import All Annotations option. For more
details, see also PDF Embedding in PDF Output of the Online Manual.
Applies to: <pdf-settings>
Values: see above
Default: none
import-tagged-pdf
Specifies whether to permit embedding tagged PDF in tagged PDF. If
true is specified, the tagged PDF is embedded “as is” without producing
an error. In GUI, you can change the setting at Allow Importing Tagged
PDF. For more details, see also PDF Embedding in PDF Output of the
Online Manual.

Values: embed | absolute-link | relative-link | richmedia | richmedia-
windowed
Default: embed
new-tagging-mode
If true is specified, when explicitly specifying an empty string such
as axf:pdftag="''", that element does not create a tag but belongs to
the tag to which the parent area belongs. In addition, the Role Map is
also enabled, and maps from nonstandard tag names to standard tag
names are valid. Specifying axf:pdftag="''" on the root element has no
effect since the root element does not have a parent: a Document tag is
always created.

<embed-font>
Specifies the fonts that are embedded in the PDF. This element

characters that are needed in the PDF output are embedded. When
this element is specified and if the font indicated here is used within
the formatted results, the glyph of the character currently used will
be embedded. For a font that is not specified, embedding is performed
only for the glyphs of the characters that are needed in the PDF output.
