Properties
The XSL-FO properties are sorted alphabetically. After a short description
of the function, the objects with which the given property can be used
are listed. In addition, the value range, the default value, if any, and the
inheritance feature are mentioned.
As far as properties in the Antenna House XSL Formatter are not
supported or are supported in an extended way, this is marked in each
case.
The referenced objects and properties are linked to their description.
Only those XSL-FO properties are taken into account that refer to PDF
or print generation.
First, the syntax for representing the range of property values is explai‐
ned. Then the data types standing for complex property values are briefly
described.
1.2.1 
The Syntax for the Property Value Types
<>
The angle brackets enclose a property data type that is generally
defined and specified in the standard. Individual and concrete attribute
values are not enclosed in angle brackets. The angle brackets are not to
be confused with delimiters for XML element tags.

1.2.3 
Properties
absolute-position 
The property positions a block container in the page. With the
default value auto the block container is positioned in the text flow
according to the given arrangement of the blocks (vertically, in the
usual arrangement for European languages). With the value absolute
the block container will be positioned fixed within its region, with
the value fixed within the page (without taking into account the
surrounding region).

alignment-adjust 
This property sets the alignment baseline position for objects without
a baseline table, e.g. graphics. The alignment-adjust property must be
seen in conjunction with the alignment-baseline property. The latter
determines the alignment to the dominant baseline (in alphabet
environments, this is the line on which characters without descender
are placed). With alignment-adjust the alignment defined by alignment-
baseline can be corrected. For this purpose, the values that are also
defined for alignment-baseline can be used. In addition, these corrections
can also be defined by relative or fixed dimensions. For example, if
alignment-baseline="baseline" and alignment-adjust="2mm" are set, then the
graphic will be aligned with the bottom edge 2 mm above the dominant
baseline.

alignment-baseline 
This property sets the alignment of the baseline position of an object
without a baseline table, e.g. a graphic, relative to that of its parent
object. In the case of the Latin alphabet, this is based on the line
on which the characters without descender are placed. The following
refers exclusively to alphabet environments. This line is the dominant
baseline. If you set the values auto (default value), baseline or alphabetic,
then the lower border of the graphic will be set to this dominant
baseline. If one selects the values before-edge, text-before-edge or hanging,
then the graphic will be displayed at the header line with the upper
border. For most fonts, the header line is slightly above the upper
border of the characters with ascender. With the values after-edge, text-
after-edge, or ideographic the graphic is placed on the footer line. this
is the line to which the character descenders approximately extend.
With the value central, the graphic is placed halfway between the
text-before-edge and the text-after-edge line. The middle value aligns the
graphic vertically at half the height of the x character (font-dependent).
The mathematical value is used only for mathematical symbols. These are
vertically aligned slightly higher than half the height of the x character.

background 
 (AHF: extended supported)
This shorthand property simultaneously sets the corresponding
background properties instead of the individual properties, either for
color (background-color), or for a background image (background-image),
for image tiling (background-repeat), for image anchoring
(background-attachment) and image positioning (background-position).
In the AH XSL Formatter, a background can also be underlayed
in page templates (<fo:simple-page-master>) and page sequences
(<fo:page-sequence>). In addition, according to the CSS concept for
backgrounds, there is the possibility to display a number of images
in one background. For each image can thereby be specified: the
path (background-image), the positioning in the page (background-position),
the tiling (background-repeat), the fixation background-attachment, the clip
area axf:background-clip and the positioning of the image original
axf:background-origin. The specifications for individual images with
their properties must be separated by commas, the property values
by spaces. According to the order of the images with their specific
settings, they are arranged in the background in descending order. The
last arrangement level can be a color (background-color), which is subject
to the whole background.

background-repeat 
This property sets the characteristics of tiling (repeating the
background image) for the background. With the default value repeat
the background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically
within the given block, with the value repeat-x only in horizontal
direction, with repeat-y only in vertical direction. If you want to avoid
the repetition, set the value no-repeat.
The paginate value has an effect when embedding multiple PDF pages.
Thus each embedded PDF page also creates a page in the PDF output.
For other formats the paginate value corresponds to no-repeat.
Applies to: <fo:simple-page-master>, <fo:page-sequence>, <fo:basic-link>,

Inherited: no
baseline-shift 
This property sets the dominant baseline of a child object (an inline
markup) relative to the dominant baseline of the parent object. For
alphabet environments, the dominant baseline is the line on which
characters without descenders are placed. With the default value
baseline, the dominant baseline remains in the position of the dominant
baseline of the parent object. With the sub value, the dominant baseline
is shifted down, so the contents of the child object are subscript relative
to the environment. With the value super the content is superscripted.
The amount of shifting is font and formatter dependent. If a percentage
value is specified, this percentage value is related to the line height of
the parent object. A positive value will shift up, a negative value will
shift down. If an absolute unit of measurement is specified, a positive
value is shifted up accordingly, and a negative value is shifted down
accordingly.
Applies to: <fo:basic-link>, <fo:character>, <fo:external-graphic>,

blank-or-not-blank 
As part of a page-master application rule (<fo:simple-page-master>), the
property sets whether the referenced page master is selected at a
particular point in the page sequence. With the blank value, the page
template is only used if a page without flowing content needs to be
generated (this is typically a left page) so that the following page
sequence can start with a right page. With the not-blank value, the page
template is used only if the page contains flowing content. For the
default value any, the page template is used whether or not it contains
flowing content.
Applies to: <fo:conditional-page-master-reference>
Values: blank | not-blank | any
Initial: any
Inherited: no
block-progression-dimension 
This property sets the height (in the left-right-top-bottom writing
direction common for European languages) for the objects below. This
property does not take effect if the height for this object is set by line-
height. With the default value auto, no constraints are set for the height.
The formatter calculates the height by the other constraints set for this
environment. A fixed value in one of the valid units of measurement
can be used to specify the exact height. A percentage value can be used
to specify the height relative to the corresponding dimension of the
nearest ancestor area formed by a block object. By specifying the block-
progression-dimension property and appending the .minimum, .optimum,
and .maximum components, the value can be flexibly specified in the
minimum-maximum constraints and the specification of an optimum
height.

force-page-count 
 (AHF: extended supported)
This property specifies for a page sequence whether and how pages
with an odd/even page number should be generated. With auto an odd
number of pages is generated for a page sequence which is followed by
another page sequence that should start with an even page number. If
the subsequent page sequence is to start with an odd page number, the
preceding page sequence will end with an even page number. If there
is no subsequent page sequence, as many pages are generated as are
needed for the content (equivalent to the no-force value). With even an
even number of pages is generated, with odd an odd number of pages.
With end-on-even the last page is one with an even page number, with
end-on-odd a last page with an odd page number.

numbers of different index classes are assigned to different page
number ranges. So, for example, if the preface and the subsequent
chapter are in one page number range and the referenced page
numbers are continuous from page 'vi' of the preface to page '4' of
the first chapter, then the page number range will be represented as
'vi-4'. If the preface and the following chapter are in different index
classes, then 'vi-xx, 1-4' will be displayed.

This property sets the starting page number for a page sequence. With
auto the page count will start with 1 if this page sequence is not
preceded by another one. For auto-odd, a 1 is added to the last page
number of the preceding page sequence, if necessary, to allow the
given page sequence to start with an odd page number. For auto-even,
the same applies for starting with an even page number. For <number> it
is possible to start with any page number.

inline-progression-dimension 
This property specifies for the typeset, possibly deviating from the
normal behavior of the formatter, how wide ‒ in writing direction ‒
it should set the box for the content. With the default value auto no
deviation from the normal behavior of the formatter is caused. With a
fixed value (<length>) the specified width is set. For content that takes
less than this width, a blank space is created in the writing direction
(right). If the content takes more than this width, the content following
in the line starts at the right end of the rectangle (overlapping the
content, if necessary!). With a relative value (<percentage>) the width is
set in relation to the direct parent object with an explicit width. With
a width range (<length-range>) the width can be set within certain limits
depending on the content.

linefeed-treatment 
This property specifies the handling of the Unicode character U+000A
(linefeed). With the ignore value, this character is ignored in processing.
With the preserve value, the linefeed character in the XML source text
is converted to a carriage return (line break) during typesetting. With
the default value treat-as-space, the linefeed character is interpreted as
a space. With the treat-as-zero-width-space value, the linefeed character
is translated to the Unicode character U+000B (zero-width space).

line-height 
This property specifies the height of a text line. For block objects
this means the minimum line height, for inline objects the exact
line height. The default for the normal value assumes the given font
size is specified in the formatter presettings, and typically ranges
between a factor value of 1.0 to 1.2. This factor value can also
be specified by the <number> value. With <length> an arbitrary value
can be set in a valid unit of measurement. With <space> the line
height can be specified in terms of minimum, maximum and optimum
height. Additionally, the conditionality and precedence can be set.
For this purpose, the following components are added to the value
name: .minimum, .maximum, .optimum, .conditionality and .precedence.

these characters can then extend into the preceding or following line.
Applies to: <fo:block>
Values: consider-shifts | disregard-shifts
Initial: consider-shifts
Inherited: yes
line-stacking-strategy 
This property specifies the strategy for lining up the lines in the
typeset. An XSL formatter must support at least the max-height and font-
height values. It can interpret line-height as max-height. When setting
line-height in the AH XSL Formatter, all lines are set according to the
setting of the line-height property.
Applies to: <fo:block>
Values: line-height | font-height | max-height
Initial: max-height
Inherited: yes
margin 
This shorthand property simultaneously specifies the properties of
margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left. If only one value
is given for the margins, then it applies to all four sides. If two values
are given, then the first applies to the top and bottom margins, and
the second applies to the right and left. If three values are given, the
first applies to the top, the second to the left and right, and the third
to the bottom. For four values, they are used in the given order for top,
right, bottom, and left. For the use of this property, see also the notes at
margin-top or margin-bottom.

media-usage 
 (AHF: not supported) 
This property controls page output in a medium with unspecified page
dimensions. With the paginate value a sequence of pages is output.
With bounded-in-one-dimension the entire content of a page sequence
is written to a page. Either the page height or the page width must
be specified in the first-used page template. The unbounded value also
writes the entire contents of a page sequence to a page. Specifying page
height or page width here will be treated as an error by the formatter.
Page height and width are thus set by the output medium. With the
default value auto the formatter sets how the page output should look
like. Typically, this value is identical to the paginate value.
Applies to: <fo:root>
Values: auto | paginate | bounded-in-one-dimension | unbounded

merge-sequential-page-numbers 
 (AHF: extended supported)
This property sets whether consecutive page number references should
be merged. With the default value merge, page numbers are merged if
the consecutive page numbers are greater than or equal to 3. This case
is seen as axf:suppress-duplicate-page-number="true". The separator can be
changed by <fo:index-page-citation-range-separator>.
The merge-f value merges two consecutive page numbers and appends
the suffix specified by axf:index-page-citation-range-f-suffix. It applies
the merge value to three or more consecutive page numbers.
The merge-ff value merges three consecutive page numbers and
appends the suffix specified by axf:index-page-citation-range-ff-suffix.
It applies the merge value to four or more consecutive page numbers.

odd-or-even 
 (AHF: extended supported) 
This property sets to what extent the referenced page template
(<fo:simple-page-master>) should be used at this point in the page
sequence. The odd value selects the page template if the given page
within the page sequence has an odd page number (is a right page),
the even value if the page is a left page. With any the page template is
applied regardless of whether the given page is a right or left page.
The odd-document and even-document values are extensions of the AH XSL
formatter. If odd-document is selected, the page template will be assigned
to a document starting with an odd page number, with even-document to
a document starting with an even page number.
Applies to: <fo:conditional-page-master-reference>
Values: odd | even | odd-document | even-document | any

overflow 
 (AHF: extended supported)
This property specifies whether the content of a block object is
truncated or not in case of overhang (content that does not fit
into the box specified in its dimensions). With the value visible the
content is not truncated, it goes beyond the given box. With hidden
the content is truncated, without scroll mechanism. With scroll the
content can be scrolled within the given box (system-dependent,
irrelevant in print output and with the AH XSL Formatter). At error-if-
overflow an error message is generated by the formatter. For hidden
the content is truncated. The default value auto is handled by the
system. For the objects <fo:block-container> and <fo:inline-container>
Antenna House has extended the range of values in the XSL
Formatter by two values. The replace value replaces the content of
the container in the overflow situation with the content contained in
axf:overflow-replace. This repeats the content until the container is filled
with the replacement content. The condense value is used to force the
contents of the container into the container dimensions, as is set with
axf:overflow-condense.

page-break-after 
This property specifies whether or not a page break should occur after
the given block. A potential page break is typically also affected by the
page-break-inside property of the parent object, the page-break-after of
the preceding block, and the page-break-before of the following block. If
these properties have a value other than auto, the always, left, and right
values take precedence over avoid. With the auto value, a page break is
neither forced nor forbidden. With always a page break is forced after
the given block. With avoid a page break is avoided. With left a page
break to a left page (with even page number) is forced (if necessary an
empty right page is generated before). With right the page break to a
right page (with an odd page number) is forced.

one page. The first value selects the page template if the given page
within the page sequence is the first page, the last value if the page
is the last page. With rest the page template is applied if the page is
neither a first nor a last page. With any the page template is selected
regardless of the page positioning.
The value second takes the second page (the page after first). <An+B>
means, you can specify in the same format as :nth() in CSS.

position 
This property specifies the positioning scheme to be used. The default
value static says that the given box is to be treated as a normal box
within the text flow. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are
irrelevant with this value. With the relative value, the positioning of
the given box is initially set by the normal text flow as well. Based
on this, the box is moved accordingly. The following box is positioned

as if its predecessor had not been moved. At the absolute value, the
box is positioned according to the top, right, bottom, and left properties.
These properties start from the box that contains the given box. With
the fixed value, the box is also positioned according to the top, right,
bottom and left properties, except that here the reference is not the
surrounding box, but the page (in the case of a page output medium) in
which the box is contained.

precedence 
This property specifies the precedence of certain
regions (<fo:region-before>, <fo:region-after>, <fo:region-start> or
<fo:region-end>) over neighboring regions. The property can only be
applied to the <fo:region-before> (header region) and/or the <fo:region-
after> (footer region)! The default value false causes the <fo:region-
start> (left page area) and <fo:region-end> (right page area) to take
precedence over the header and footer areas, i.e. to occupy the entire
page height. In the opposite case (true), the header and footer have
precedence over the page regions. Thus, the header and footer extend
to the entire page width.

provisional-distance-between-starts 
This property specifies the distance between the start of the list label
and the start of the list body. The property value is not processed
directly, but is taken into account in the calculation of the body-start()
function. body-start() (the indentation of the list body) is equal to the
left indentation for the given list within the parent box, if any, plus
the indentation for float blocks, if any, plus the value for provisional-
distance-between-starts.
Applies to: <fo:list-block>
Values: <length>
Initial: 24.0pt
Inherited: yes
provisional-label-separation 
This property specifies the distance between the end of the list label
and the beginning of the list body. The property value is not processed
directly in the formatting, but is taken into account in the calculation of
the label-end() function. Considering that the list label and the list body
are both left-aligned, the <length> value specifies the minimum distance
between the two list objects.
Applies to: <fo:list-block>
Values: <length>
Initial: 6.0pt

property is only applicable to objects that form reference areas.
As of the standard V.1.1, the specification of reference-orientation
in <fo:region-*> has no effect unless it is repeatedly specified
in <fo:page-sequence> with the value of the from-page-master-region()
function.

ref-id 
This property specifies in directories the reference to the object that
has the specified unique identifier in the id property. The reference can
be generated by the XSLT function. For index ranges, the value of the
property in <fo:index-range-end> refers to the value of the same name of
the id property in <fo:index-range-begin>. Both objects thus enclose an
index range. Otherwise, the reference is to any id object with the same
name.

retrieve-position 
This property specifies the preference for taking a <fo:marker> content
as a living page heading. For the default value first-starting-within-
page, the <fo:marker> object that occurs first on the given page,
for example a section starting on that page, is preferred. For first-
including-carryover, the section that wraps from the previous page to
the given page is preferentially rendered as the page heading. Forlast-
starting-within-page, the last <fo:marker> object starting on the given
page (for example, a section) is preferred. For last-ending-within-page,
the <fo:marker> object ending on the given page is preferably chosen.
This only works if the <fo:marker> object stands inside a container object
that denotes the scope for <fo:marker>. For example, this is a section,
and the <fo:marker> content is the section heading for use as living page
heading.

rule-style 
This property specifies the line pattern for leaders. The property is only
applicable if at the same time the leader-pattern property has the rule
value. For the none value, no line or one with width of 0pt is created. At
dotted, the pattern consists of a sequence of dots. For dashed, the pattern
consists of a sequence of short line segments. For the default value
solid, the pattern consists of one continuous line. With double, a double
line is created. The sum of the two lines and the spacing between them
is equal to the value of the rule-thickness property. With groove the
upper part of the line is displayed in full color (usually black) and the
lower part of the line is lightened according to the line thickness. ridge
corresponds to the groove value with the difference that the line appears
full-color at the bottom and lightened at the top.

scaling-method 
 (AHF: not supported)
This property specifies a preference for the scaling method of bitmap
graphics. With the default value auto it is up to the formatter which
method is used to scale the graphics. The integer-pixels value is
intended to cause the formatter to scale each pixel in the original to the
nearest integer number of pixels output to achieve a smaller or equal
image size, taking into account height, width, and scaling instructions.
With the resample-any-method value, the formatter shall use a method of
its choice to handle the image according to height, width, and scaling
instructions.

measure specifies the distance measure. Adding the .minimum component
specifies a minimum spacing, .maximum specifies the maximum
spacing, and .optimum specifies the optimum spacing. Applying these
components gives the so-called vertical wedge, i.e. pages of equal
height with different spacing between blocks for which these
component specifications are given. With .conditionality and the value
discard it is specified that the spacing specification should be ignored
at a page break. With the retain value, the spacing will be maintained
even if a page break occurs at the top of a new page. With .precedence

component specifications are given. With .conditionality and the value
discard it is specified that the spacing specification should be ignored
at a page break. With the retain value, the spacing will be maintained
even if a page break occurs at the top of a new page. With .precedence
and an integer value, precedence or subordination to a space-after
specification is specified in the preceding block.

This property specifies decorations (typically underlines, overlines,
strikethroughs) that can be added to the text of an object. The default
value none negates any decoration. The other values, as long as they are
not mutually exclusive, can be used in combination: underline causes
an underline, overline causes an overline, and line-through causes a
strike-through. The blink value is only useful in interactive applications.

text-shadow 
This property specifies a list of shadow effects that will be applied
to the text of an object. With the default value none no shadow is
created. With the values <color> the shadow color is defined, to which
values of type <length> are added. A shadow is positioned by two length
measures relative to the position of the normal text character: The
first length specifies the horizontal distance (with positive values to
the right, with negative to the left), the second the vertical distance
(with positive values down, with negative up). Optionally, a blur
dimension can be specified with the third length (ignored by the AH
XSL Formatter). The length groups of a color are separated by commas.
The constraints of this feature are described in the Online Manual at
text-shadow. They concern some output formats, font aspects and others.

treat-as-word-space 
 (AHF: not supported)
This property specifies whether a character is to be treated as a space
or as a normal letter. With the default value auto only the space and
the permanent space (U+0020 and U+00A0) are treated as word separators.
In a font, other characters may be classified as word separators. These
characters are treated as if the true value is specified, i.e. they are used
to expand lines to equal width if necessary (justification). With true the
designated character is specified as word separator. With false the use
for expanding the line is prevented.
Applies to: <fo:character>

===PAGE 199===
writing direction of this embedding layer is set by the value of the
direction property. The bidi-override value is used to override ordering
in inline objects or block objects that contain only inline objects. This
means that the ordering within the object strictly matches the value
of the direction property. The implicit part of the Unicode bidirectional
algorithm is ignored.
Applies to: all objects
Values: normal | embed | bidi-override
Initial: normal
Inherited: no
vertical-align 
This property specifies the vertical alignment of inline blocks and
within table cells. With the baseline value, the baseline of the given
block is aligned with that of the parent object. With middle, the vertical
center of the given block is aligned with the baseline of the parent
object plus half the height of a lowercase letter in the parent object.
With sub, the baseline of the given block is lowered relative to the
baseline of the parent object for subscript text, and raised for super
for superscript text. This does not reduce the size of the font! With
text-top the text of the given object is aligned to the parent object's top
line, with text-bottom to the bottom line. With top the text is aligned
to the headline of the line, with bottom to the footline of the line. With
<percentage> a relative value is specified. If this is a positive value, the
baseline will be moved up according to the line height, if negative,
it will be moved down. A value of 0% is equivalent to baseline. An
absolute value is specified with <length>. If this is a positive value, the
baseline will be moved up according to the line height; if negative, it
will be moved down. A value of 0mm corresponds to the value baseline.
Applies to: inline objects and table cell objects

visibility 
This property specifies the display or suppression of the display.
With the default value visible the content is processed normally
and displayed in its box. With hidden the generated box is invisible
(transparent), but it is included in typeset and pagination. With collapse
the invisible box also no longer takes up any space.
Applies to: all objects
Values: visible | hidden | collapse
Initial: visible
Inherited: no
white-space 
This property specifies the treatment of whitespace characters within
the text. With the default value normal sequences of whitespace
characters are reduced to one space. The whitespace characters are
used for line breaks, if necessary, and eliminated in the process.
Additional line breaks can be generated by inserting \A in the text flow.
Space reduction is avoided with pre. Line breaks are generated only
where line breaks or \A stand in the text flow. With nowrap, sequences
of spaces are reduced to one (like normal). However, spaces are not used
for line breaks. Only at \A in the text flow are line breaks set.

directly before a linefeed character are eliminated. With false no
whitespace treatment is performed.
Applies to: <fo:block>
Values: false | true
Initial: true
Inherited: yes
white-space-treatment 
This property specifies how whitespace and corresponding characters
with whitespace character should be handled in the text flow. With the
default value ignore-if-surrounding-linefeed all whitespace characters
immediately preceding or following the linefeed character are
eliminated. With ignore, only the whitespace characters preceding the
linefeed character are eliminated. With preserve, all space-characters
are converted to spaces (U+0020) and preserved. With ignore-if-before-
linefeed, the spaces before the linefeed character are eliminated and the
spaces after are preserved, vice versa for ignore-if-after-linefeed.

width 
This property specifies the content width of blocks. The default value
auto says that the width is set by other properties. With <length> a
width is set in a valid unit of measurement. With <percentage> a relative
width with respect to the parent object is specified.
Applies to: all block objects
Values: <length> | <percentage> | auto

Inherited: no
word-spacing 
This property specifies the spacing between words. The spacing is
system-dependent and is also influenced by the alignment of the lines.
The default value normal denotes normal spacing, which is affected by
font, font size, and typesetting system defaults. The <length> specifies
a value in a valid unit of measurement, which is added to the default
word spacing. Negative values can also be specified, but there may be
system constraints on these. <space> allows to define a range for word
spacing which is added to the default word spacing. The minimum
and maximum values denote the limits for adjusting the word spacing.

writing-mode 
 (AHF: partially supported)
This property specifies the writing direction for reference
area forming objects. Applying writing-mode to page templates
(<fo:simple-page-master>) sets the top, bottom, right, and left placement
of page areas. The writing direction within the areas sets the direction
of the text flow and how blocks are lined up. With the default value lr-
tb, the writing direction goes from left to right and from top to bottom.
Changing the writing direction within a page area is possible within
<fo:block-container> and <fo:inline-container> objects. In tables, writing-
mode causes horizontal alignment of columns or cells, corresponding to

vertical alignment of table rows. This allows tables to be rotated. The
rl-tb value specifies the writing direction for Arabic and Hebrew (right
to left and top to bottom). tb-rl specifies the writing direction from top
to bottom and right to left (for Chinese and Japanese). lr is a shorthand
for lr-tb, rl one for rl-tb, tb one for tb-rl.
As of the standard V.1.1, the specification of writing-mode
in <fo:region-*> has no effect unless it is repeatedly specified
in fo:page-sequence with the value of the from-page-master-region()
