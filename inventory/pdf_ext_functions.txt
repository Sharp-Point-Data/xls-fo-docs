AHF Extensions: Functions
cmyk() 
The function cmyk() is equivalent to the function
rgb-icc(#CMYK,<C>,<M>,<Y>,<K>) (see rgb-icc()).
cmyka() 
The cmyka() function has 5 arguments: cmyka(<C>,<M>,<Y>,<K>,<A>) (see
also rgb-icc()).
hsl() 
hsl() is a function in CSS3 and specifies the hue saturation lightness
(HSL). The 3 arguments to it are hsl(<H>,<S>,<L>). <H> is a number
without a unit of measurement. For <S> and <L> percentage values or
the values from 0.0 to 1.0 are allowed.
hsla() 
hsla() is a function in CSS3 and specifies the hue saturation lightness
(HSL) with an additional alpha value. The 4 arguments for it are
hsl(<H>,<S>,<L>,<A>). <H> is a number without a unit of measurement.

For <S>, <L> and <A> percentage values or the values from 0.0 to 1.0 are
allowed.
rgb-icc() 
The extension of Antenna House concerns the color formats initiated
with # for gray values, four-color printing (CMYK), and spot colors.
Argument names used in the following:
‒
<R>,<G>,<B> = %-values or integers from 0 to 255
‒
<C>,<M>,<Y>,<K> = %-values or numbers from 0.0 to 1.0
‒
<Scale> = %-value or 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (white)
‒
<Tint> = %-value or 0.0 (brightest value) to 1.0 (darkest value).
Specify gray values. The intensity of the gray value is set with the
<Scale> argument:
rgb-icc(#Grayscale,<Scale>)
Specification of four-color printing according to the CMYK format
(cyan, magenta, yellow, black). If the RGB specification is missing, the
RGB values are derived from the CMYK values:
rgb-icc(<R>,<G>,<B>,#CMYK,<C>,<M>,<Y>,<K>)
rgb-icc(#CMYK,<C>,<M>,<Y>,<K>)
Specification of spot colors. The color name is specified as <Name>,
e.g. as PANTONE 131 PC. The tint is entered as <Tint>. If <Tint> is not
specified, the tint is assumed to be 1.0. Furthermore, RGB or CMYK
must be specified. If the RGB specification is missing, the RGB values
are derived from the CMYK values:
rgb-icc(<R>,<G>,<B>,#Separation,<Name>,<Tint>,<C>,<M>,<Y>,<K>)
rgb-icc(<R>,<G>,<B>,#Separation,<Name>,<Tint>)
rgb-icc(<R>,<G>,<B>,#Separation,<Name>)
rgb-icc(#Separation,<Name>,<Tint>,<C>,<M>,<Y>,<K>)
rgb-icc(#Separation,<Name>,<Tint>)
rgb-icc(#Separation,<Name>)

If the option "AH Formatter PANTONE®" is included in the license
for the AH XSL Formatter, the PANTONE colors are automatically
converted to RGB or CMYK values. Then you can write the function as
follows:
rgb-icc(#Separation, 'PANTONE 131 PC')
